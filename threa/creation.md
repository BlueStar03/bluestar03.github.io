## Working Notes

I am going to describe the creation story of Threa. it involves the element Fire, Wind, Earth, Water and their children, Lightning and Ice 

a bit on the nature of the elements. for they are not actually elements, but the closest approximation to their true nature. earth is something with shape, with firmness, which can resist movement. can be solid as stone, or crumble like dust. He is strong like a mountain but timid like dust. Water is that which moves back and forth, shapeless, fluid. she is aloof, self-centered, and moody, like a calm pond, or a ranging wave. Their son, Ice is that which has shape and can be shape that can move and stay. like a glacier or snow. Fire is that which radiates in all directions, He is warm, determined, and passionate, like a hearth that fills a room with warmth and light, or a volcano that spews consuming lava. Wind is force, the push and pull at a point at a direction. She is thoughtful and headstrong, like a gentle breeze pushing a boat, or a hurricane pulling up trees. their daughter, Lightning is that which is energy, action, that which moves everything. She is spontaneous and energetic, like a sudden flash that wakes everyone up, or the crackle that lifts hair to their ends.

a way to view their characterizations: Earth is "Firmness" Water is "Fluidity", Fire, is "Radiance", and Wind is "Force". while Ice is "Being", and Lightning is "Action"





Fire is emotion, how a smile radiates happiness, and crying fills a room with sadness, like a flame fills a room with light. It is the heart, the source of warmth in the body. Wind is thought, for it is thought that directs movement, from here to there. It is breath which drives force.

Lightning, the daughter of fire and wind, is both. Emotion and thought creates action, the spirit

Earth is what has form, like bones and flesh. Water is what flows, like blood. Ice, the son of Earth and Water, is both form and fluid, flesh, and blood, being, the body. and together, Ice and lightning make sentient life

earth is something with shape, with firmness, that can resist movement. can be solid as stone, or crumble like dust. he strong but timid. Water is that which move back and forth, shapeless, fluid. she is aloof and self centered and moody. like a calm pond, or a ranging wave. their son, Ice is that which has shape and can be shape that can move and stay. like a glacier or snow, form. Fire is that which radiates to all directions, He is determined and passionate, like a hearth that fills a room with warmth and light, or a volcano that spews consuming lava. Wind is force, the push and pull at a point at a direction. she is thoughtful and headstrong, like a gentle breeze pushing a boat, or a hurricane pulling up trees. their daughter, Lightning is that which is energy, that which moves everything. she is spontaneous and energetic, like a sudden flash that wakes every one up, or the crackle that lift hair to their ends.

a way to view their characterizations: Earth, the nerd is "Firmness" Water, the misfit is "Fluidity", Fire, the Jock, is "Radiance", and Wind, the cheerleader, is "Force". while Ice, and introvert is Existence, and Lightning, an extrovert is "Action"

their personalities are akin to a nerd, misfit, jock and cheerleader. Earth is the nerd. he knows how to build, but is afraid to change what has worked so far, that he has made a mistake. he is infatuated by water and aspires to be as confident as Fire. . Water is a misfit. she is self centered and just want to go where she wants, do what she wants to do, not caring about any one else. she changes he mind constantly, doing this one day, them doing that the next. she doesn't stick to one idea. she doesn't pay noticed to Earth but looks up to Wind. Fire is a jock. thinking he is the best at everything, even in things he is bad at. has a rivalry with Wind, thinks of Earth as his little brother. Wind is the cheerleader. full of energy and competitive, but she is undecisive. She doesn't want to be outdone by Fire and thinks of water as a little sister that can be molded by her. Ice and lighting are the younger. Ice is an introvert, reserved, he thinks before acting. Lighning is an extrovert, impulsive. she acts before she thinks.



Fire and Water are siblings. Wind and Earth are siblings. Additionally, Fire and Wind are "older" around early to mid adulthood. While Earth and Water are "younger", late teens/ young adults. Earth and Fire are "Male" while Water and Wind are "female". This is just for their characterization as time and biology is meaningless to them. Eventually, Fire and Wind end up together, as do Earth and Water. Additionally, Ice and Lightning are "Children" about 10 years old. Ice is a boy, and Lightning is a girl. They are not siblings. Ice is the son of Earth and Water, while Lightning is the daughter of Fire and Wind. They are best friends. Neither has more dominance over the other. Ice is more meek, cautious and thoughtful. Lightning is impulsive, energetic, and assertive. 

This metaphysical aspect is the true nature of the Elements, but it is unknown even to themselves. As such they themselves do know the true extent of their power and potential. Their elemental aspect is simpler to perceive and comprehend.

the names Fire, Wind, Earth, Water, Ice and Lighning are simply the easies way to understand them. It is that Fire controls fire, but that which radiates, which fire is does. Wind isnt just wind, but that which exerts force, like the wind. Earth is not rocks, but that which is firm, like rocks. Water's dominions isnt water, but that which flows, like water does. Ice isnt ice, but that which can be acted on, like ice, which has little to no energy. and Lightning isnt lighning, but that which acts, that moves, like lighning, which has little to no form 

From the Empty Void. The Primordial Elements came to be Earth Water, Fire and Wind. They each created a world of their own. Fire Created his to show that he is the best. Wind, taking it like a challenge, made hers to rival Fire's. Having observed Fire and Wind, Earth crafted his, hopefully water would be impressed. she did not even noticed. Bored, Water made hers. All four made their own worlds, by themselves, and they all failed.



they all failed in making a world. Nothing ever happened on earth's world. to afraid to change anything, that it crumbles apart. Water's world did not sit still. Water's could not make up her mind, flowing from one thought to another, nothing could take hold. Fire's world was full of destruction, nothing would last. Wind's world was ever changing, blown in on place today, another place tomorrow. nothing they did would fix their worlds. so they stopped intervening and they all abandoned their worlds

Some age later the element got together and discussed their failures. Fire noted that they alone failed. Wind, made a realization, however, she did not like the idea, to make a world together. Water agreed that all four should make a world together. Earth took a chance and suggested to work in pairs. Fire and Wind should work together. Only water didn't realize the Earth paired her with him. With this plan, they set of to work



Earth provided the firm foundations to their new world. Water provided flowing change around their new world. Fire radiated warmth everywhere on their new world. Wind moved all their forces on their new world. this world was grander than their previous attempts. this world, Threa showed great promise. Fire and Wind brought the Sun, while Earth and Water brought the Moon. Flora and Fauna began to emerge, to prosper.  



and yet, they failed again. the results was still much grander than their individual world, but it was empty. they prepared to abandon this world as well. still, they reflected on their work together. Wind didn't feel she needed to surpass Fire, and fire didn't feel he needed to be the best. They enjoyed each other company. Water finally notices Earth, and appreciates his efforts. Earth is glad that water finally noticed him. They enjoy each others company. As they were to depart, Two new elements are born, The daughter of Fire and Wind, Lightning. and the son of Earth and Water, Ice.

Ice and lightning entered Threa. as children, this whole world was their playground, bringing life everywhere they went. the plants and the creatures. but then, they together brought forth the first people. the first race to step on the world of Threa, the Nawa. Inspired by their children, Earth, Water, Wind and Fire decided to do the same. Earth and Water brought forth the Dreavi. Fire and Wind brought forth the Aetha

---

a bit of clarity. the metaphycals nature of the elements, their true selves, which is unknown to them.

Earth, Firmness, is stability

Water, Fluidity is change

Together, the brought forth Ice, Form, who is Matter.

Fire, Radiance, is Emotion

Wind, Force, Thought

Together, the brought forth Lightning, Action, who is Energy.

which is why Ice and Lightning were able to create the Nawa, the first people of Threa. Matter, that is stable, yet can change, provided the body, the bones and blood and everything in between. Energy, which is emotion and thought, provided the soul, that fill the body with warmth and draws breath. in its nexus is the heart, which is firm and always changing, and pull and pushes the body, filling it with warmth thru thought and emotions. for when the heart stops, the person can no longer think or feel, the body can no longer change or move. the essences of the element separate. the warmth ceases, the last breath is drawn, blood stops flowing, and the body decays. 

---

The Aetha and the Dreavi know they are created, and who their creators were. they offered a level of veneration which the primordial were uneasy with. they blame their involvement on their previous worlds for their failure. they do not want to repeat their previous mistake They charged the Aetha and Dreavi to care for this world. on the other hand, the Neo Elements, Ice and Lightning, had not experience such a failure, they played and intervened across the land, alongside their Nawa. The Nawa also knew they were created, but offered no veneration to their creators, in turn, the Neo didn't ask for any. they were content as is. for an age, The perfects, Nawa, Aetha and Dreavi, were the only ones in Threa.

The Primordials resolve to leave Threa in the care of the Dreavi and the Aetha. they would depart from the world. Before they parted however, the primordial crafted an artifact each. If the Aetha and the Dreavi needed for the primordial to intervene, they can wield the artifacts instead. as they would grant the wielder the power each element wields. Earth's Bracelet and Water's Earring were given to the Dreavi. Wind's Armband and Fire's Ring to the Aetha. it would be their choice how to wield their power, how to shape their own destinies

The Dreavi and the Aetha spread throughout the world, caring and guiding Threa. With the power granted to them from the Artifacts, they shaped the valleys, protected the forest and ran the rivers, brought upon the season, they made it rain, and droughts. they lead the creatures to migrate, to flock, to stamped and hibernate. made the flowers bloom and wither. 

Still, the Primordials could stay away for long. Fire stepped back inside Threa. Remembering on how he and Wind created the Dreavi, he proceeded to bring forth the Lor, the people of Fire. Wind saw what Fire was doing and reprimanded him for intervening. Fire insisted that he was not, but creating. Wind tried the same thing, and brought forth the Aria, the people of Wind. Shortly after, Earth and Water joined them. Earth studied how Fire and Wind created the Lor and the Aria. With this knowledge, he brought forth the Dis Com, the people of Earth. Water, exited by this change, brought forth the Ma Hir, the people of Water. 

The Primordials wanted something different for the Pures, The Perfects know they are created, they know the elements. The Elements however, want to sever that connection, that knowledge, with the Pures. Fire and Wind asked the Aetha to guide the Lor and the Aria, to shape them as the see fit. Earth and Water asked the Dreavi to guide the Dis Com and the Ma Hir. to mold their futures. All without the knowledge of the Elements. with that, they departed again. but not to far.

The Aetha and the Dreavi pondered upon this new task. How to guide the Pures, as they were blank slates. They could place themselves to be venerated. some thought the idea was enticing, but it was shot down. they thought about ignoring the elements, another idea was to have the pures join them. For the pures to be an extension of Aetha and Dreavi culture. it would be the easy path. but it was shot down too. each race was taken to distant places in the land of Threa. The Lor were taken at the base of a volcano on the west. The Aria were placed on top of a plateau in the east, The Dis Com were taken to a vast plain in the north, and the Ma Hir were taken to a gulf in the south. The Dreavi and Aetha took on the appearance of those who they were guiding. One village was built for each. they were told how to live of the land. Perfects lived among the Pures, disguised as them, guiding them. first the where the parents of the first generation, then the grand parent of the second, when the third generation were born, they removed themselves. the let the Pures grow and expand across the land. eventually they will each meet, when the expanded far from their first villages. at that point, it will be their decision on how they will treat each other. The perfects themselves, went back to being stewards of the world of Threa

The Elements themselves stayed in Threa. they to the forms of their creations, Fire took the form of a Lor, Wind of an Aria, Earth looks like a Dis Com and Water like a Ma Hir. they stayed nearby to watch their creations grow.

before the Perfects left the Pures, they awarded the artifacts to the current ruler of their wards. Fire's Ring to the Lor King, Wind's Armband to the Aria Queen, Earth's Bracelet with the Dis Com Elder, an Water's Earing to the Ma Hir Chief. The perfects no longer need the power of the elements, but the Pures might.  

Meanwhile, the Nawa grew dependent upon Ice and Lightning. As long as they remained obedient, the Neo will provide them with everything. it took a while, but the Neo noticed this too. They saw the Primordial Perfects thrive, And now the Pures are thriving by themselves too. The Neo decided to abandon their Neo Perfects, the Nawa. they did not want leave them alone, but they had to thrive by themselves. Unable to survive for themselves. the nawa entered the populations of the Pures and mixed with them. The Nawa are capable of changing their form, and so, they assumed the form of the population they mixed with. The Nawa was no longer one people, they ended up separated from each other, as the lived and learn among the Pures. As each generation of Nawa were born, they retained the form of the society they had joined. Believing they where one of them, and becoming unaware that they were in fact Nawa

the primordials now lived among the pures, they still maintained their distance, but still were part of the lives of their creations. leading to interesting interactions. on one occasion, Fire, in the form of a Lor smith, bowed to the Lor King at that time. Earth as an Dis Com farmer experience the kindness of a Dis Com elder, having the town help with his harvest. Water, as a Ma Hir warrior was "defeated" by a Ma Hir Chief of an opposing kingdom, she decided to yield to chief skill, not because she was overwhelmed, for she was Water, could will a torrent to drag the Chief down to distant depths, but was humbled by the skill her creation was able to wield. and Wind provided feast to the Aria Queen, as an Aria Chef. Ice and lightning still roamed across the world as themselves, unbound. yet, as the ages passed, they felt directionless. that there was nothing else to do. Lightning proposed to seek out her parents for advice. 

Ice encountered Fire, working in his humble shop by a dead volcano. Ice was intrigued by the the life Fire is living. Fire explained that this is just the latest identity. The existence of the Pures is limited, Each Lor, like a flame, will one day be extinguished. one day, the warmth he provides will leave them, becoming cold, no matter how they live their lives, that day is resolute. Ice reflected that he brings cold wherever he goes. From this sentiment, Fire and Ice brought forth the Morts, from Fire and Ice, the people of death. Fire reached out to the Dreavi that was taking care of the dead volcano. Fire asked this Dreavi to care for the Morts.

Lightning found her mother, Wind, in a field of flowers. Lightning was intrigue by the life her mother has chosen. Wind explained how each Aria wanders thru their lives, encountering the good and bad and choosing what to do next. lightning reflect on how she zigs and zags everywhere. wandering from place to place. From this sentiment, Wind and Lightning brought forth the Laurils, from Wind and Lightning, the people of Life. Wind located the Aetha that was keeping watch over this field of flowers and asked her to guide the Lauril

Ice then found his father, Earth, on a dessert.

aren't you a farmer? why are you here where no crops can grow? asked Ice.

Earth then mentioned that it is important to contemplate the ground beneath. Thou the Dis Com till the soil, move it, crack it, the ground remains strong. its integrity uncompromised as it supports everything it is built upon. Ice reflects on his glaciers, strong and uncompromising. from this sentiment, Earth and Ice brought the Zeur, the people of strength. a dreavi was near by. Earth charged this Dreavi to take care of the Zeur.

Lightning found Water in a jungle. Your far from the waters. said lightning. not at all, quipped Water, all these trees, and plants and vines are full of water. THe Ma hir get to discover new thing here on the land, and grow wiser in the process. Lightning reflect on how she illuminate the night, reveling new discoveries. with this sentiment, Water and Lightning bring forth the Minka, the people of Wisdom. a shy Aetha was nearby. Water aproached her and asked her to take care of the Minka. 

Fire and Earth met one day on a grassland. next to Forrest. they mused on the behavior of the the Lor and the Dis Com. How some, motivated by the unavoidable death, act towards their own benefit. How some build their own strength at the expense of others. how some act in an egotistic manner. from this, Fire and Earth brought forth the Murai. the people of the dark. they found an aetha living in the grassland. Fire and Earth asked him to care for the Murai.

Water and Wind had a chat together in a forest, near a grassland. Wind relished on how some Aria share their experiences on the skies they have wondered. Water noted how some Ma Hir share the discoveries they make. how some act in an altruistic manner. from this, Wind and Water brought forth the Jin, the people of the Light. a dreavi living in the forest offered his service to care for the Jin

With the Mort, Lauril, Zeur, Minka, Murai and Jin, the Unions join the Pures. at this time, the Pures have expanded to cover a great deal of land. The Lor and Aria had a few wars between them. No one contested the Ma Hir's fresh water claims. The Dis Com however have lost territory. in this landscape, do the Unions have to carve out their claims. Only the Murai grew to challenge the Pures, expanding beyond their cradle, the vast grasslands. the rest ventured not far from their own cradles, the dead volcano, flowery field, barren dessert, deep jungle and dense forest. they made their homes there. these where the first six Unions, the first generation, there were six more to come

Ice took his mother, Water, to the southern snow fields. a place that has a tranquil coldness, there is barely anything here. completely blocked off from the rest of Threa by a formidable mountain range to the west, and harsh waters at all other directions. No one has ever stepped in these lands, that is why there is tranquility and harmony. Lets see, said Water, with that, Water and Ice brought forth the Imoh, the people of Harmony. they sought a poor Aetha, freezing while taking care of this wasteland. The elements asked him to care for the Imoh. The Aetha was exited to finally have something to do.

Lightning took Earth just outside a great city. the city was filled with people from all over Threa. thou it was a Lor city, Aria also lived there, as do Ma Hir, some Dis Com, Murai, Zeur and Minka. Still, it is not fully harmonies. there is Chaos in the city some lord over other, some are in bondage to others. some are free while most are not. earth mention that there is a balance between chaos and freedom. From this, Lightning and Earth brought forth the Corlee, the people of Chaos. a nearby Dreavi was scaring travelers to the city. Lightning and earth had no option than to ask her to guide the Corlee, right after she scared another wagon of travelers. 

Earth and wind had a conversation.

have you seen this one tree up north with deep roots that anchor it to the ground? said Earth.

yeah, the one that reaches up high to the sky. how about waterfall in the south? which the water is so high, it feel like rain.

Yes, said earth, the one that hits the luscious ground bellow. Or the cliffs on the east? a big majestic solid rock. asked earth

the one with a beautiful sky and intricate clouds. and the caverns on the west, where the wind hollers thru them. replied Wind.

the ones where the tunnels and cave shape the wind.

They reflect on how these distant places should be together. From this, Earth and Wind brought forth the Nink. the people of community. they are the smallest of all, no taller than a foot. unlike the other, the Nink had four cradles: the North Tree, the Eastern Cliffs, the Southern Falls and the West Caverns. They asked the Aetha and the Dreavi in those regions to guide the Nink. these four had to coordinate together in order to guide the Nink

Fire and Water had a chat in a tundra. There is barely any warmth here, said Fire. and the small amount of water is hoarded by the plants with thick barks and needles for leaves. mentioned Water This environment is harsh. Everyone here must be able to pull their own weight, be self-reliant, in order to survive. With this, Fire and Water brought forth the Rowlf. the people of resiliency. a unique race that stood in four legs, they could be mistaken for beasts. An Aetha and a Dreavi had cabins nearby. the elements ask for them to guide the Rwolfs.

Wind came across Ice in a vast farmland. Living on this farmland would be simple, as long as they work hard, this land can be bountiful. pretty straight forward really. with this, Wind and Ice brought forth the Redn. the people of simplicity. The Aetha charge with this farmland was exited that finally see this fertile soil was going to be put to use.

Fire met Lightning deep inside a tropical rainforest. She was in awe by the complexity of the place. how everything was intertwined and interconnected. with this, Fire and Lightning brought forth the Kapopa, the people of complexity. The Dreavi taking care of this rainforest took charge of the Kapopa, to guide them thru the complexities of this world.

The second generation Unions, Imoh, Corle, Rowlf, Nink, Redn and Kapopa join the the first generation Unions in Threa. Like the first Unions, the second ones emerge into a world already populated. they too had to carve out their own lands. the imoh had the entire southern snowfield to themselves, fully isolated from everyone else. The corlee on the other hand had a Lor city as their cradle, the slowly took over it, controlling the trade and economy of this city and any other place they expanded their trade network, by any means necessary. the Ninks migrated across their four cradles, the north tree, southern falls, eastern cliffs and western caverns. The rowlfs lived in packs on their tundra, The Redn shared their bountiful harvest with their neighbors from their farmlands. The Kapopa spread to various forests and woodlands, mastering their skills, but they always made a pilgrimage back to their tropical rainforest. 

The world of Threa was nearly complete. However, Ice and Lighting had not yet made a pure of their own. With what they had learned, they proceeded to do that. Ice went to a swamp, a place cherished by his parents, Earth and Water, Ice brought forth the Frills, the people of Ice. Lightning went to a place cherished by her parents, Fire and Wind. She went to a prairie, where the sun shone bright, and the winds passed swiftly. Lightning brought froth the Duga, the people of Lighting

Upon creating the Frills and the Dugan, ice and lighting decided to guide them themselves. they did not want to repeat the same mistakes they did with the Nawa. they did not want to abandon their pures without guidance. for the Nawa are now lost within the Lor, Aria, Dis Com and the Ma Hir. No one know that the Nawa exist, not even themselves. They each assumed the form of their mortal pures. Lightning positioned herself as their queen, in contrast, Ice placed himself as a Cleric. On their third generation, the neo left their pures, so they may keep shaping their own destinies. Before departing, they too created artifacts like their parents before. Ice's Pendant and Lightning's Diadem. They were bestowed to their mortal successors. Now, ice and lightning join their parents in living in Threa in mortal form, experiencing their world just how their creation do.

Much of this knowledge faded from memory. Only the Aetha and the Dreavi know the history of creation, and of the elements themselves too. From time to time, the aetha and dreavi cross paths with the element in their mortal forms, aware of who they really are. The Pures and the Unions forged their own Destinies across the world of Threa, unaware of their creation.

Parts of this history still survive, scattered across a multitude of myths.
