## Synopsis {#synopsis}

## Characters {#characters}

### Main Characters

- **Lyndi (Player Character)**: She is an orphan who was adopted by a wealthy family later than most children. She chooses to return to a modest lifestyle and decides to become a nurse, inspired by her caretakers at the orphanage. The headmistress of the orphanage and the director of the nursing school are friends, and Lyndi was admitted to the school on the headmistress's recommendation. She is described as cheerful, tomboyish, and determined. She is compassionate and selfless, always seeing the positive in people, but she can also be reckless and somewhat absent-minded. She has friends living near the hospital. As a nurse, she is knowledgeable, proficient, dedicated, and has good bedside manners, especially with children, although she tends to be more emotional than logical. 

- **Lannet (Companion Character)**: She comes from a challenging family background, where her parents frequently argue and her father struggles with alcohol addiction. She has two older brothers, one younger brother, and two younger sisters. Despite the lack of support from her family, Lannet has achieved success through her own determination and hard work. She is intelligent, quiet, reserved, assertive, and determined. Lannet is known for her strong-willed nature and does not appreciate intrusive behavior. She chose a career in nursing to create a better future for herself, distinct from the issues faced by her family. As a nurse, Lannet demonstrates proficiency and extensive knowledge. While she can maintain a polite demeanor, she is often perceived as distant and cold. However, she consistently provides exceptional care for her patients, always going above and beyond in her duties.

They both studied nursing together and were roommates but have never been friends. Lannet is distant and focused on her studies. They are both top students, though Lannet has higher marks. Despite their differences, Lannet respects Lyndi for being a great nurse, but finds her nosy and meddlesome at times. The director describes them as two sides of the same coin, with Lannet being focused and Lyndi being warm, two important aspects of being a great nurse.

### **Act 5: The Ward - Practice**

**Narrative**: Lannet and Lyndi arrive at the ward, a large open room with 60 beds, organized in 4 rows. Not all beds are occupied—there are **40 patients** in total. From **left to right**, each row has **13, 8, 10, and 9** patients, with the rest of the beds empty. There are two veteran nurses present, **Flannie** (the focus nurse) and **Wilma** (the warmth nurse), and they instruct Lannet and Lyndi to help them check the patients.

### **Row Selection**:
- There are **two center rows** and **two outer rows**.
  - If **Lyndi picks a center row**, Lannet will pick the other center row.
  - If **Lyndi picks an outer row**, Lannet will pick the closest center row.
  - If **Lannet has to pick first**, it depends on which veteran nurse is closest to Lyndi:
    - If Lyndi is **closest to Wilma**, Lannet will pick one on the left side (either outer left or center left). Otherwise, she will pick one of the right rows.
    - If **Lannet’s frustration is low**, she will go to the row with the most patients on the chosen side. Otherwise, she will go to the one with the least patients.
  - For the **veteran nurses**:
    - Whichever nurse is **closest to Lyndi** will pick the closest row that aligns with their trait.
    - **Wilma** will pick the row closest to Lyndi, and **Flannie** will pick the row closest to Lannet.
    - The remaining veteran nurse will take the last row.

**Prompt**: "So you are the two new nurses helping with rounds today. You two can check one row."

### **Action**:
- **Check charts** and **talk to patients**. They may have requests that Lyndi can choose to fulfill or not.

### **Struggle**:
- When **Lannet has passed her fifth bed** and Lyndi hasn't reached her fifth bed, if Lannet is in an **adjacent row**, she will prompt: "Just check the charts and check the patients, keep things moving."
- If **Lannet is not in an adjacent row**, there will be no struggle prompt.

### **Fail**:
- Moments after **Lannet finishes her row**, she will go to Lyndi's row and finish whatever is left.

**Additional**:
- **Patients may have requests**, such as getting water or telling a joke. Lyndi can choose to **comply or refuse**.

### **Veteran Nurses (Flannie & Wilma)**:
- At the end, **Flannie and Wilma** notice the dynamic between Lannet and Lyndi, similar to what the director sees. One nurse will comment on **focus**, and the other will comment on **warmth**.
- **Whichever nurse finishes her row first** will make the comment. Both nurses are faster than Lannet, but their row’s difficulty determines which one finishes first.
- If Lannet has to do **one bed on Lyndi's row**, the veteran nurse that finishes first will comment on Lannet:

  - **Focus on Lannet**:
    - **Neutral**: "You're focused. Lyndi can learn something from you."
    - **High Frustration**: "You're pushing hard, but you need to watch your stress levels, Lannet."
    - **High Respect**: "You always give it your best, Lannet. Your focus never falters."

  - **Warmth on Lannet**:
    - **Neutral**: "Your touch is a bit cold. You need to warm up to your patients."
    - **High Frustration**: "You're efficient, but it's showing in your demeanor. Patients can sense your stress."
    - **High Respect** (Subtle): "You handled things well today, but remember that a little warmth goes a long way."

- If Lannet doesn’t have to finish any of Lyndi's row, the veteran nurse will comment on Lyndi:

  - **Flannie (Focus)**: "Your focus is spot on. You two make a great team."
  - **Wilma (Warmth)**: "Your smile brings warmth to your patients."

> ### **Impact on Lannet**:
> - **Increase Frustration**:
>  - Every bed Lannet has to finish in Lyndi's row.
> - **Decrease Frustration**:
>  - Not triggering the struggle state.
> - **Increase Respect**:
>  - Fulfilling additional tasks and requests from the patients.
>  - Finishing her row.

## Act 6: Going Upstairs {#act-6}

- **Narrative**: After completing their tasks in the ward, Lyndi and Lannet head to the stairwell and proceed up to the second floor.
- **Hidden Element**: During the ascent, a subtle dialogue prompt appears, indicating that Lyndi has something she wants to say. Holding the dialogue button to bring up the ring menu is the only way to engage in this conversation.
  - **Conversation Start**: Lyndi asks, "Lannet, why aren't we friends?" Lannet replies, "What are you talking about?"
  - **Replies**:
    - **Frustrated Replies:**
      - "You always push me away, even when I try to help."
      - "You never let anyone in, do you?"
      - "Why do you have to be so difficult?"
      - "We could have been close if you'd just let your guard down."

    - **Somber Replies**:
      - "I thought after nursing school, we'd at least be close."
      - "I guess some things just never change, right?"
      - "Do you ever wonder what it would be like if we were actually friends?"

    - **Reflective Replies**:
      - "Remember our first year? I always admired how focused you were."
      - "I learned a lot from watching you. You were always so determined."
      - "Sometimes I wonder if I could be as dedicated as you are."
      - "Maybe we just have different ways of caring, but I think we make a good team."

- **Lannet’s Reactions**:
  - **To Frustrated Replies**:
      - Lannet looks intensely at Lyndi for a moment.
      - Lannet says, "Shut up."
      - Lannet says, "Stop being nosy."
      - Lannet stops, her right hand balls into a fist and shakes for a moment, then she resumes walking silently.

  - **To Somber Replies**:
      - Lannet looks down.
      - Lannet says, "Stay focused."
      - Lannet says, "Don't worry yourself."
      - Lannet stops, crosses her arms, and remains silent for a moment, then resumes walking.

  - **To Reflective Replies**:
      - Lannet takes a deep breath.
      - Lannet says, "I..."
      - Lannet closes her eyes for a moment.
      - Lannet stops, hands at her sides, looks down briefly before looking up and closing her eyes. She then resumes walking.

  - **End of Conversation**:
Upon exiting the stairwell, regardless of the conversation's state, Lannet pauses and says, "Focus, we still have work to do," ending the dialogue.

  - **Conversation Mechanics**:

    - Normally, pressing the dialogue button will cause Lyndi to issue a simple greeting: "Hey, Lannet," to which Lannet always responds with "Not now," ending the conversation. Each attempt increases Lannet's frustration.
    - If the player pulls up the dialogue ring menu without a subtle dialogue prompt, it will just show the greeting dialogue and nothing else.
    - In the stairwell, when the subtle dialogue prompt appears, the ring menu will have "Lannet, why aren't we friends?" as an option. Selecting this starts the conversation.
    - After Lannet says, "What are you talking about?" the ring menu will show three of the replies, one from each category (Frustrated, Somber, Reflective). Selecting one will prompt Lannet's response.
    - Each time the ring menu is pulled up, a different set of three replies are shown. The dialogue button must be held for some time to bring up the ring menu, consuming time during the limited duration of the stairwell scene.
    - Pressing the dialogue button without pulling up the ring menu will cause Lyndi to stutter, prompting Lannet to stop briefly and respond with "What?" This increases Lannet's frustration.
    - The ring menu also has the option to end the conversation, with Lyndi replying, "Never mind," which decreases frustration.
    - Once outside the stairwell, after Lannet says, "Focus, we still have work to do," the interaction behaves as it did before, with Lyndi saying, "Hey Lannet" and Lannet replying, "Not now," dropping the conversation. The ring menu no longer shows additional options.

> #### Impact on Lannet:
>  - Increase Frustration:
>    - Engaging in the frustrated dialogue options.
>    - Stuttering during the conversation.
>  - Decrease Frustration:
>    - Not having the conversation.
>    - Choosing somber dialogue options.
>    - Ending the conversation with "Never mind."
>  - Increase Respect:
>    - Choosing reflective dialogue options.

## Act 7: Private Rooms {#act-7}

- **Narrative**: Lyndi and Lannet arrive at a hallway on the second floor, with three doors on the left and three on the right. These lead to private rooms reserved for important individuals. Lannet takes the three on the right, while Lyndi takes the three on the left.
- **Prompt**: "You will check on Mr. Roth, Ms. Liya, and Mr. Gregor on the left."

- **Action**:
  - Update each chart, ask about each patient's well-being, and complete one task to enhance their comfort.
  - Interaction Options: The initial interaction with each patient changes based on whether Lyndi just opens the door, knocks, or knocks and announces herself. In addition to long-pressing, pulling up the action ring menu will also give the option to knock (action ring menu) or announce herself (dialogue ring menu).

- **Struggle**:

    Before Lannet enters her first room, if Lyndi simply opens the door to her first room (by pressing the action button), Lannet will say, "Long press the action to knock at the door and long press the dialogue button to announce yourself next time." Lannet will enter her first room in such a manner, cluing the player on how to do it properly if they wait for Lannet to go first. Once Lannet enters her room, or if Lyndi knocks and announces herself, there will be no struggle.

- **Fail**: Once Lannet finishes with her three rooms, she will complete any mandatory tasks that have not been completed in Lyndi's rooms.

- **Lannet's Speed**: Lannet's speed in completing her tasks depends on how the stairwell conversation (Act 6) went:
        Mostly Frustrating Replies: Fastest speed.
        No Engagement or "Never Mind" Without Issuing Other Replies: Normal speed.
        Mostly Somber Replies: Slower speed.
        Mostly Reflective Replies: Slowest speed.

- **Patient Order**: Patients can be tended to in any order.
  - Mr. Roth
  - Ms. Liya
  - Mr. Gregor  
    
- Lannet's patients
    
  - Tina
  - Mr. Yara
  - Ms. Zoe
  -

- **Narrative**: Mr. Roth is a wealthy donor to the hospital. There isn't really anything wrong with him; he's just taking a "vacation" to get away from it all. He is happy and cheerful.
