## **Act 1**
**Start of Rounds - Action Tutorial (Hidden Quick Action)**

- **Scene Setup**: The screen fades in from white, panning down to reveal the area in front of the head nurse's office in a hospital.

- **Narrative**: Lannet startles Lyndi, causing her to drop her clipboard. Lannet picks it up and hands it back to Lyndi.

- **Prompt**: After Lannet picks the clipboard and begins handing it back to Lyndi, "Here, take it."

- **Action**: The player is to press the action button to grab the clipboard.

- **Struggle**: If no action is taken, Lannet prompts: "Press the action button and take it."

- **Fail**: If Lyndi doesn’t grab the clipboard, Lannet shoves it into Lyndi's hands.

- **Hidden Tutorial**: Before Lyndi is startled, a quick action prompt appears. If pressed in time, Lyndi retains her composure instead of dropping the clipboard.

- **Hidden Element**: This is actually a hidden quick reaction tutorial. As soon as the scene fades in, Lannet approaches Lyndi from behind, startling her, which causes the clipboard to fall. The quick reaction prompt allows players to prevent the clipboard from dropping.

- **Impact on Lannet**

  - **Increase Frustration**: Lyndi being startled (failing the quick action). Lannet shoving the clipboard into Lyndi's hands (failing the action tutorial).

  - **Increase Respect**: Lyndi retaining her composure (quick action success)
