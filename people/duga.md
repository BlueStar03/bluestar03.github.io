## Working Notes

This is a description of a race of people that live in the world of Threa, The Duga.

There is very little variance between individuals. Duga are 5ft tall, slender in build. They have four digit hands and two toed feet. The inner toe is bulbous, and the outer toe is flat. They have triangular ears at the sides of their head. They have a wet nose, with males colored red and females colored pink. Their skin color is various shades of pale yellow-orange (peach) and their hair and eyes are yellow in color, with a rare red-orange. their skin is covered in a light fuzz. They have a prominent left upper canine tooth. Their hair part above their left eye, males tend to let their hair cover their right eye. additionally, their hair from the back splits. for males, it splits into two ribbons, one larger than the other one. for females, it splits into three, with the center ribbon being the longer one. Males tend to keep their hair longer, passed the waist, while females keep their hair no longer that shoulder height.

As they age, the Duga experiences some changes. Their ears lengthen as they age. As children, their ears are short and point downwards. Once they are adults, their ears are long and point straight out, or even upwards. once they become elderly, their ears continue lengthening and droop downwards. Another change they experience as they age are the various markings on their bodies. certain regions of their skin darken to black as they age. They are born with no markings. At certain ages, their skin darkens in certain areas. Between ages 3 to 5, their ear marking develops. Between 7 to 11 years, their lower eyelids darken. From 13 years to 17, they develop their legs and feet markings. At 18 till 22 their arms and hands are marked. 23 thru 25, their upper eyelids and entire eye socket darken. From 26 till 30, their face markings show. Most of these markings aren't too distinct between individual, with certain randomness. however, two of them are specific. Their ear marks are inherited from their father, and their face marks are inherited from their mother. There are 10 types of ear and face markings. Siblings have the same ear and face markings. If a Duga meets a stranger with the same markings, they treat each other as siblings. In turn they refrain from partnering until their face marking show. Especially if they already have the same ear marks. 

The Duga have no nation, no territory. they wonder throughout the various nation, doing whatever they can to survive. they have no culture, adopting whatever culture of the land they are living. only one ritual survives of whatever past culture that once existed. For the marriage ritual, the couple to marry share food from the same plate, usually the sip soup from the same bowl. then they gift something from themselves to their spouse. could be a spoon, a ribbon, any of their possessions. 

The Duga suffer from a selective amnesia. when a significant person passes away, they fully forget that person ever existed. as soon as they realize the person is gone, they forget them. for example, when a parent passes away, they forget who their parent was. they are unable to recall their face, their name, any moment they had with their parent. a consequence of this trait is that they cannot grieve. thou there are occasions in which they incorrectly realize a significant person passed away. When that happens and they meet that person again, they suffer an unrelenting grief. 

It is common for Duga to be born fraternal twins. Single births are rare

There is one small colony. They are attempting to establish a cultural identity. their nomadic lifestyle doesn't make it easy for Dugans to cross each other's lives. By happenstance, five Dugans met at the same time. They eventually founded the colony a generation ago. a number of Dugan that have come across the colony elect to stay. some even seek a pilgrimage to the colony, even if they are just passing by as it is the only sence of cultural identity they have. Colonial duga wear long mandarin shirts, short sleve, long sleeve or sleeveless. and simple pants. the body of the mandarin shirt is white or another pale, off white color. the pants, sleevs and colar can be rich blues or greens. Wondering Dugans wear whatever clothing they have access to.

Long ago, in their forgotten pass, there were 10 families. which is why there are 10 different ear and face markings. there are also 10 family names: Tag, Var, Ker, Xen, Mic, Nim, Roc, Soz, Guf, and Luz. However, Mic and Guf are now extinct, no one carries those family names. A few generations passed and the ten families could not agree on various aspects. Rather than conflict, they chose to separate. Eventually they all left and turned into wanderers. Another cultural aspect that survived the separation, besides the marriage ritual, is their choice weapon, Blades. Blades deals high Slash damage, moderate pierce damage and no blunt damage. As wanderer, they rely on their Blades for protection. Duga Blades are basically giant knives. They can be single edge or dual edge. They commonly carry two.

Fully unknown to them, the Colonial dress adopted by Colonial Dugans, is the same style that the ten families wore long ago. as if it is something innate within them. however, a similar tragedy appears to be playing out. as factions in the colony are developing. unable to agree would they walk out like the ten families did before them, or will they choose conflict and assert their view. or they may find compromise and avoid both separation and conflict.

Their naming convention include a personal name and a family name. their personal name can be one of a pool of name. foe males, those names include: Relim, Velim, Tenim, Denim, Serim, Danny, Vinny, Larry, Terry, Wally, Roul, Daul, Kano, Bano, Kaus, Mike, Leon, Dion, Rike and Devo
Female names are: Sorra, Dilla, Lilla, Rilla, Nikki, Tilli, Vikki, Sona, Dona, Luna, Rena, Neko, Tina, Vela, Sonia, Dania, Lunia, Reina, Naria, Tadia and Velia.
their Family name can be one of the ten family names, with the exclusion of the the two extinct names. there is no established norm of passing down family names. some are the mother's name; others are the father's. for others, the son gets their father's family name and daughters get the mother's, or the other way around. some may alternate, and some may even flip a coin. 

1. Lightning is the creator of the Duga. she did not want them to suffer the loss of someone dear to them. so she gave them this trait. it is part of their nature.
2.There are two main factions. one is that they should forge their path forward, with no need for reverence of the past. to focus on today and tomorrow, not on yesterday. unless there is value of it today, disregard tradition. The other side is to revere and honor the past, to try and piece together their history and adopt it. an example is the marriage ritual. one of the few traditions that has survived, unknown in to them that it was created by Lightning herself. some Duga colonials seek new wedding traditions. that since they are a blank slate, they should feel free to try and invent something new. while other uphold the traditional ritual, to the point that that some view marriages that used other rituals as invalid and wrong. in turn, some that use new traditions may look down upon those still holding to outdated practices. if they were good, why did they fade  thou, some "reconstructed" traditions are actually new
3. The Duga are the rarest people any one would see outside the colony. they may be viewed as a bit exotic. but since wanderers adopt the local culture, they tend to blend in. thou they still stand out, if not just by their looks, they may exhibit cultural aspects from were they have wandered about. mixed clothing, sayings, gestures.
4. they accidentally stumbled to their ancestral vestment. some are still looking what their ancestor clothes was. They were an egalitarian meritocratic monarchy, with a mining based economy. 
5.When the Duga where first created, there were 10 males and 10 females. Each pairing adopted one of the 10 family names, including Mic and Guf. this original pairs still have descendant, but their names are no longer passed down. Because of how inconsistent name inheritance traditions were, eventually, there were in a situation in which those names weren't passed down. nothing is stopping them from re adopting those names, but they are not even aware it existed. plus, even if they were adopted, it might not be from an actual descendant of those lines.
6. Some colonials do try to embrace the Duga Blade in ritual, ceremony and symbols.. Even crafting ornate ceremonial blades. Wanderers don't care. it is a simple versatile tool. not just for combat, but general cutting, and digging, 

7.eventually the colony will split. the traditionalist will stay where the are, and the progressives will seek new lands. both will grow into diverse nations, to mean not just Duga, but include other races as well. the traditional nation would still be lead by duga, while the progressives will by one of many. ironically, the progressives would one day claim the land that once was their ancestral cradle. 

8. There are 3 ways The Duga form Families. The most common is a split family. Two wanderers meet and decide to pair. And have their children. Twin births are very common. About 6 months to a year after birth, the family splits. One parent takes one twin, and the other parent keeps the other twin. So there are two parent - child families from this union. Each keeps there wandering lifestyle with their child, they may or may not cross paths again. however, only the parents know they are family. The parents would one day pass away. When the child realize their parent has died, they forget who their parent was. From their perspective, they are seeing the body of a stranger. They do have a tradition to honor someone who has passed away. And provide funeral rites if possible. Lightning did not for see that since they no longer feel attached to their parent they were basically cold and disrespectful to their passed loved ones. so she started the practice of honoring any dead they may encounter. And then they just keep wandering on their own, until they have their own child, and wander with them until they pass. if the end up crossing after one parent has passed. they may not recognized each other. however their body markings do give them a clue. since face and ear marking are hereditary. if someone their age has the same markings, they may be siblings. and if someone older has one of their markings, they may be their absent parent. 

the second type is a more standard form, in which the family stays together. mainly if the firstborn is single, rather than twins. thou nothing stops them from staying together if their firstborns are twin. the family may continue wandering together. it is common for the parent to have twins on the second birth. this union families tend to have three children, the older singlet and the younger twins. rarely do Dugan families have four or more. It is birth of the singlet as their firstborn that triggers union families. split familie, each parent takes one twin, and tend to no longer have any more children. whit a singlet born, the family cant split, as one parent wont have a child, so they stay together. only if they have two or four children, can they split, each taking half. but also the more children, the harder is it to wander, so if they settle, which is common if they have three children, the family wont split. the union families can wander together. but they may also settle and stay in one place. Wanderers travel light, so they don't have many possessions. Settled Unions may find themselves in a house full of someone else's possession . their fathers lucky coin suddenly becomes a coin. in one instance, a duga named Dona Luz, decided to wander, leaving her family's farm. she was the singlet, and had the twins brother and sister. during the time she was wandering, her parents passed. she came back to the farm after many years. when she asked about their parent, the twins had no idea who she was talking about. Dona told stories about them and their parents, but the twins did not recognize any of the event, thou they had a sense of familiarity. when the twins figured that she was referring to the two duga buried by a nearby tree, that is when dona's own amnesia hit her. she even forgot the stories she was just telling them. the twins now had a better sense on who their parents were, but dona only had a recount of her own recount. 

with a split family, when their present parent passes, they effectively have no familial ties. as they spend less than a year with the absent half, they are essentially strangers if they ever meet. additionally they only spend a short amount of time with their partners, two or three years before they split. with union families, they spend more time with their partners. when their partner passes, they will still have their children, and when their parent pass, they will have their siblings. their siblings will remain alive most of their lives, passing away at their old age. their parents tend to pass away when their children are adults. 
and because of their wandering nature, it may be until their late adulthood when they find a partner. and it is easier to find a partner for wanderer then settled families, as such, not long after the parents pass, settled children become wanderers. the sibling may start wandering together, but will split from their siblings once they find partners and have children.
for colonials all this is different. as they can have extended families, the third family structure. since they are always surrounded by other Duga, they may find partners early in their life, and star a family when they are young adults. giving more time for their children to have children of their own, becoming grand parents. So, when their partner passes, they still have their children and grand children. when their parents pass, they will have their siblings and children. and when their siblings pass, they will still have their partners, children and grandchildren. and because families stay in one place. the colony, aunts and uncle, and cousins are also present. however, their amnesia still makes it a challenge to maintain such extended family ties. thou colonials have a better understanding of their amnesia that the wandered. and have devise ways to counter it. for there is a clerical institution of historians and artisans that that maintain a record of the family ties. they create artwork depicting linage. however. this historians must remain detached from everyone so they don't succumb to the amnesia and forget those who they record. 

a bit more about the selective amnesia. it is trigger by realizing a loved one has passed away. and by loved ones, it is not just limited to family, but also friends. Wanderer, effective being detached from everyone, effectively preserve their memory. for the amnesia wont trigger if they find that some shop keep the came across years ago has passed. for settled, they may forge friendships with their neighbors, triggering the amnesia when their dear friend passes. for outsiders, not understanding their amnesia, the duga may appear cold hearted, suddenly refusing to acknowledge the passing of a dear friend.  in the colony, with grater understanding of their amnesia, they receive better support. additionally, in the colony, since not everyone is a loved one, just an acquaintance. it is common to find someone who remembers your father, even thou you and your family and friends don't. additionally, their acquaintance, and hated ones don't trigger the amnesia, so if they hate their parent or sibling, it wont trigger it. this adds to the negative view of wandering duga, as they wont remember their mothers, but they still remember someone who owes them money. or if one encounters a duga that does remember their father, its because they hated them.

one character is Sonia Var. she is the singlet daughter of Dona Luz, and Raul Var. They settled outside Welst Town. tragically, Sonia lost her parents when she was an infant, they were murdered. this triggered her amnesia. she was adopted by a friend of the family, whom Sonia viewed as a grandfather. some years later, the elderly grandfather passes away. he was cherished by the townsfolk. but seeing that his adoptive granddaughter fails to acknowledge him, she failed to attend his funeral. the townsfolk have a negative view on her, and she in turn has grown detached from the townsfolk. Sonia can deduce that she had parents, since everyone has them, but just thinks that she was to young to remember them. but has no way to deduce grandfather. and since the townsfolk dislike her, they aren't informing her about his existence. the shop she runs,she inherited from her grandfather, further fueling the townsfolk dislike. as she owns the shop that the given to her by the very person she has forgotten.

with Sonia Var's narrative. She will be a player character in a video game which pick up shortly before she becomes a wanderer. she holds that the disdain of the townsfolk towards her stems that she isn't a Corle, the race that populates the town. while still running her shop. the tax enforcers harass her frequently, thou mostly because they are punks, but the townsfolk do nothing 'cause they hold it is well deserve for her ingratitude towards her grandfather. Rose Vito, one of the tax enforcers, successfully takes control over the shop and she leaves and starts wandering. on her travels, she keeps crossing paths with a Frill boy. this grows to a friendly rivalry, becoming a loved one, someone that will trigger the amnesia. she eventually wanders into the colony. learning more about the duga, and their selective amnesia. with this understanding, she goes back to Welst Town, to piece together her story. she eventually deduces that the old abandoned shepherd's house was the house her family settled in. she directly asks various townsfolk on what happens and that is how she learns about grandfather. Additional, now that she understands the duga's selective amnesia, she realizes that the frill boy is destined to be forgotten. Note that this is a minor aspect on her story. it is a side story that the player may choose to explore or not. and the quest becomes available only if the player ever finds the colony first. 

9. The ear and face marking are inherited from their parents. The ear marking are inherited from the father, and the face markings from the mother. There are a total of ten unique markings for each type. They correspond to the original Duga population created by Lightning. She created ten males and ten females. Making ten pairs, ten families. The ears marks create a patrilineal line to one of the first ten males, while the face marking create a matrilineal line to one of the first ten females. However this knowledge is not known. 
When a wanderer encounters an elder sharing one of their markings, they are treated as a parent, as there is a chance that this is true. If they encounter someone of a similar age sharing both markings, they treat each other as siblings. As this may also be true. The other markings don’t signify anything other than their age. 
for colonials, the importance of the family markings is a bit diminished as they maintain family records. Plus it is no much of a surprise meeting someone sharing one of their marking, which is a rare event for the wanderers. 
in one occasion, two wanderers met, Tilly and Leon. Leon was older and had recently developed his face markings. Tilly was the younger and had yet to develop her face markings, thou she was at the age it would start to develop. They both shared their ear marks. Meaning there was a chance they could be siblings. 

just to be concise.
Duga fall into two broad classes, Wanderers and Colonials. Wanderers are the vast majority. They don’t stay put in one places. They travel from town to town, city to city and anywhere in between. They may stay for a week, or a few years. but they don’t really have a permanent presence anywhere. they work odd jobs to get by. they carry few possessions. Two common possessions are their blades and the wedding gift. The Duga blade is versatile and simple weapon that helps them defend themselves, in addition it can be used as a general cutting tool and a shovel. The wedding gift is a possession from their partner that they receive during the traditional wedding ritual. Their clothing tends to be a mixed of the various places they have been. 
Many wander alone. A fair amount wander in pairs. They can be partners, (Friends, unwed couple, wedded couple), a parent and child split family, or two siblings (two singlets or a twin pair). Few wander in packs of three, two parents and their singlet child, three siblings (a singlet and twin pair, or the very rare three singlets), One parent and two children (two singlets or a twin pair) or three partners (three friends, one friend and one couple, unwed or wedded, two siblings and a friend, two siblings, with one in a couple). Four or more are virtually nonexistent, as a family of four or six would more likely split, and a family of 5 or more would settle. Wandering in pairs is ideal, so when partners have twins, making them four, they split creating two wandering pairs. Wandering in three is possible but harder, so when a singlet is born, making them three, a fair number decide to settle. The are still classed as Wanderers, as they are not colonial. So Traveling Wanderers and Settled Wanderers, or just Settled. 
Split families is when each parent takes half the children, maintaining the ideal wandering pair, or the still functional wandering trio. They will only split if they have even children.  Union Families are when the parents stay together, more likely because they have odd number of children. If wandering becomes harder, because of a large number in their pack, and they can’t split, because their number is odd, they may choose to settle. Settled Wanderers, or just Settled Duga, have a more permanent presences in wherever the find themselves at. They maintain a residence and are employed in more common jobs, like farming. They start accumulating possessions. They may stay for decades, for the rest of their lives.  The children may one day leave and start wandering. After the passing of the parents, the family is small enough to wander. Additionally, unless someone wanders to them, they may not find a partner. Even if the parents are still alive, one of the family may decide to wander for some time, typically the singlet. Traveling siblings may spit off from their siblings when they find a partner, or have a child with their partner. Twins are the normal births, identical and fraternal. A birth of a single child is rare, and are labeled as singlets
The other class are the colonials. They started after a wandering pack of five friends decided to join an not to split. So they settled. They bought a farm. As other wanderers passed by, they were invited to stay. The farm has grown to three towns. Since they don’t have to travel to find a partner, couples start earlier, late teens, early adulthood, and start families earlier. For wanderers, they typically start their families at mid to late adulthood. Allowing them to become grand parents. Family size is no longer a concern, they wont split. As such, aunt and uncle, and cousins are also present.Colonial duga have extended families. 

the wedding gift can be any possession, sometimes the even exchange blades. unknown to them, it is common for the wedding gift actually be a family heirloom. the wedding gift is given to their child, typically when they teach their child the ritual. when the parent passes away, triggering the amnesia, the wedding gift becomes a long held possession of the child. so, when they themselves wed, they feel this possession is an adequate wedding gift. they have children, the couple splits, taking the wedding gift. the spouse then gift it to their child and the cycle repeats. there is still a chance the wedding gift stops being an heirloom, if the item just breaks for being to old, or they have greater attachment to something else. actually, Lightning's Diadem is a family heirloom. passed down across many generations as wedding gift, then handed down to their child, and then again as a wedding gift many times over

Lightning's Diadem is one of six Elemental Artifacts that grant its wielder complete dominion over the element. When lightning departed, she granted the Diadem to an Aetha, to look after the Duga. Eventually, the Aetha Jolie Anelin gave the Diadem to an orphan Duga named Danny Ker. When he wedded, he gave the diadem as a gift to Sona Tag, he got her blade in exchange. Relim Ker is a notable wielder. He was a general during the Grand War. He was able to tap into the power of the diadem to achieve victory in the war. Eventually, Dona Luz inherited the Diadem, which was gifted to Roul Var. Their daughter, Sonia Var is the current wielder, after her parents, Dona and Roul, were murdered. 

1. The amnesia is triggered when the individual realizes the loved one has passed away, and not from them actually passing away. So the loved one may have passed away some time ago, the the person still remembers them, until they are informed of their passing. The experience is a short daze, no more than 10 seconds, once they regain focus, the memories are forgotten. if they were presents at their passing, they are suddenly in front of a strangers body. it is inevitable, once they can deduce that passing has happened, the amnesia triggers, they are unable to deny it. Colonials maintain journals of experiences, with illustrators creating images of the events. while the individual can know that what is in the journal is true, they cannot remember them. The memories are forgotten but not gone. they are 'locked up'. if the individual realizes that the passed loved one is actually alive, say that they actually survived shipwreck, rather than perished in it, the memories return. this experience is with an overwhelming grief, that may require a fair amount of time to recover. a second amnesia will not happened, the recovered memories will not be forgotten from amnesia, maybe from old age. however, this is a high bar, it must be beyond hope, beyond any and all doubt, like actually seeing them again.

a story that involves the reversal is about twins Relim and Vikki Ker. they were separated during a raid before the Grand War. they presumed each other died during the raid, triggering their amnesia. years later, Vikki was in a city under siege. Relim was leading an army sent to reinforce the city. by chance she got a glimps at her brother charging at the invaders. her reversal trigger, it nearly made her unable to evacuate the city. now that she remembered her brother, she sought to meet him. eventually she ended joining his army. however, it wasnt until he was mortally wounded when they finally met. Relim being a season warrior by then, had experienced many amnesias, from various soldiers under his command, so when his reversal triggered, he was able to cope thru it. they shared his final moments. Vikki mourned his brother at his funeral. she did not forget him afterward.

2. Wanderes dont care much about having little to no cultural identity. they do cherish the little heritage they pass down, blade forging, wedding ritual and few other things. but they also readily adopt anything that is useful, throughout their travels. traveling wanderes have a mix of clothing, mannerism, and traditions from the places they have traveled. While settled wanderers integrate to the place they have settled. 

For the Colonials, there is a certain pride in what they have accomplished. To have a society like everyone else. But there is also a degree of bitterness and resent. On why is it difficult to have something that is natural for anyone else. Their amnesia makes it difficult to maintain traditions, heritage, anything that ought to last more than one lifetime. To feel distant to their own traditions. Even the work of historians, there is a sense of fear that historians may craft their own stories and narratives, and have little way to confirm if what the historians record is true or not. There are some that return to being wanderers, finding it easier, rather than deal with legacies, liniages, and heritage 

Duga have no issues in cosmopolitan regions. They can wander freely there. In more homogeneous regions, they have to be careful. For one, they have to be aware of any aspect they have adopted that has perjudicial views. Mainly dealing with the tensions between the Lor, Aria and Murai. They must also be aware of the laws of were they wander. Where they equals or sub class, what actions may break laws, and what laws they want to break. The various races have a variety of views. But because of their rarity and detached demener, there is an air of mystery and exotic. 

4. with one traveling wanderer, they have full control on what they do, they can assume any risk they want, they only need to provide for themselves. With two adults, they both need to agree on what actions to take, the risk is shared, both can provide for each other. So, there are cost and benefits with a pack of two adults. and if they don't agree, they go their separate ways. Three adults are similar, more hands working together, but harder for the three to agree on everything.  The dynamic grows more complicated with more individuals. If children are part of the pack, it changes the dynamic. children have limited capacity to contribute to the pack, but still need to be provided for, they also must be kept safe, limiting the amount of risk they can take. A parent-child pair provides the most freedom, as the parent is the one that makes all the decisions. If the parents stay together, they may clash over what to do, with their children being an additional factor. Since twins are common, it is easier to split, each takes one child, and wanders as they see fit, considering the welfare of the child they have. There are few that stay together and make wandering work, thou it is more challenging, considering the wants and needs of all four individuals.  If a singlet is born, they can't split, they feel it isn't right for one to keep the child and the other to be left alone. they stay together and wander together. It is the easiest configuration to raise a family as there are two parents to care for one child. However, it still has its challenges. settling makes having a family easier. It helps provide safety and can increase the contributions the family has. since in order to travel, they must remain light, and often discard anything that may incombered them. another factor is if the family wants to stay together, irrelevant of size. if the couple does not want to split, but traveling is too hard.

duga tend to have wander light, having few possessions. there are three that a Duga commonly have:
Duga blade - a multi used tool that is used for cutting, shoveling, hunting and defense. 
Heirloom - an item that is passed down from parent to child, and to their partners during the wedding ritual, it can be any item, and it may not necessarily be the same item they got from their parents that they give to their partner, and then down to their child. thou some have managed to have multigenerational heirlooms. their blade may be their heirloom.
trinket - an item that is used to identify themselves. It can be any item, but typically some accessory or coin. It can change through their lives, but only ever have one at a time. it can be the same as the heirloom. the trinket becomes part of the funeral ritual

marrige ritual:
they sit across each other, the sun at their side, and the heirlooms next to them, opposite to the sun, with a food item in between them, provided by the proposer. the proposer grabs the food and gives it three half turns and places it in front of the proposed. then the proposed ingests half of the food. they then give the food item three half turns and places it in front of the proposer. the proposer then grabs the food item and finishes ingesting it. the proposer then grabs their heirloom and places it in front of themselves. the proposed reaches across, grabs the heirloom and places it next to themselves, on the sun facing side. then they grab their own heirloom and place it in front of themselves. the proposer reaches and grabs the heirloom and places it on their sun facing side. if any heirloom can be worn, they will put it on. and to finish, they both lean forward and kiss each other. this is just the base, it can be more elaborate. the food item tends to be soup or tea, or just water. bread, pastries, or other prepared meals are also used. some sort of slab, board or short table may be used to place the food item, but it can be placed on the floor. the moon can also be used instead of the sun. no witnesses are required, but it is always better to perform the ritual in front of others. 

Funeral Ritual:
since a duga will forget any loved one that passes, they will honor any body they encounter, is it could have been a loved one that just passed away, and already forgotten. first, they will identify their trinket, as it can be any item, but that item will have scratch marks, their signature. if they dont have a trinket, most likely because the body isn't of a duga, they will choose someting in the bodies possetion to serve as their trinket. they will a pyre to burn the body to ash. then they will bury the ashes. the trinket will be set on top of the ashes. Ideally, the trinket would be set in something, like a rock or carving, and set above where the ashes are buried, but being buried on top of the ashes is also acceptable. 


born as a twin. one their first year, they all remain together, as a pack of four, both parents and the twins. after the year, the family splits, with one parent taking one of the twins a pack of two. for many years, a duga is raised by a single parent. when their ear markings appear, they can have their first trinket. it is rare for a duga to keep this first trinket but it does happen, and may change it as they please but it is not ideal, as the trinket is part of their identity, like their name, and constantly changing trinkets makes it hard for them. when their lower eyelid marks appear, their parent teaches them how to forge a duga blade, how to maintain it, repair it. the blades become essential in their survival as wanderers. if they come across other duga, they may exchange blades. when their leg markings shows, their parent will hand them their heirloom, teach them the weadding and funeral rituals. the parent-child pack of two may last until the child develops their arm markings, or when the parent passes. becoming a pack of one, wandering alone. when their upper eyelid markings appear, they may seek out other packs, joining as friends. they may even start to seek a partner. it is not until after their face marks show that they may wed and have a child. they both will care for their twin children, pack of four, until their first birthday, and split, taking one child, pack of two. they will care for the child and impart what they have learn as they wander together. until the child is old enough and leaves, pack of one. they may still wander, remain alone or join other packs. one pack they may seek is joining back with their partner. exchanging their trinkets as a second wedding. when they pass, they will be cremated and their ashes buried, their trinket ant op of their ashes

a short narrative illustrating what happens when a parent passes in front of their child:
- "felt dizzy there for a moment"
my eyes feel odd. i reach to wipe them
-"was i crying?"
i look in front of me. there is someone there, laying down, eyes closed.
- "excuse me sir"
i nudge the person in front of me. their skin is cold. i notice that he doesn't draw breath. he is dead....
 who is he? why is he here? why am i here?
either way, i have to honor him. 
-"where is his trinket"
i search his body for his trinket. mine is a coin i carry. i scratch a triangle on one side and three lines on the other. this coin was given to me. it was .....
-"who gave me my coin? i know it was someone special. was it my father? ...."
-"who is my father?"
i look at this man's ear. he has the same markings as me. is he related to my father? to me?...
is he my father?
-"i don't know"
i cant remember him. i found his trinket. it is a medallion. it has a signature, with a triangle like mine. 
-"was he my father? did i made this scratches? i cant remember"
still, whomever he was, i will honor him. as if he was my father.

i go outside and find a clearing. i gather some wood, some kindling, and build a small pyre.
"i know this. i know how to honor him, but how?" i move his body and place it on the pyre. i watch it burn, turn to ash. i contemplate who this man was. who my father was?
i know who my mother is. i saw her a few years ago, with my brother. we packed together for a few months, and then we split back up. my brother and mother packed together. who did i packed with? alone, or my father? with this man? 
the fire is nearly out. there is nothing but ashes. 

there is a tree nearby, i dig a small hole near the tree. i collect the ashes and place them in the whole, and cover it up. i set the medallion on the trunk of the tree. 
-"if you are my father, it is by this tree were you will rest."

i gather my things and i keep traveling. 

ust information that clarifies the context of the narrative. the man was her father. he had been ill for some time. she was by his side when he passed. fearing the worst, she began to cry. once she realized he was dead, she felt dizzy for a moment. once she recovered, she had forgotten him. she still remembered her mother and twin brother. in that event years ago, she did infact packed with her father, just as her brother packed with their mother. she could reason, she could deduce that he was her father, but there were no memories, no emotions for him, unlike moments ago when she was crying, fearing the most. 
she could reason that they both had the same ear marks, which are inherited from the father. his trinket has a mark that looks like she carved it. and from the event years ago, when she and her father crossed paths with her mother and brother, who were wandering together. they reunited briefly, rejoined as a pack of four for a couple of months, and split back again. with part of that memory gone, she deduces that just like her brother and mother pack together, she must have had packed with her father, otherwise she would be packed with her mother and brother. if her father was there, they would have split into two packs of two, and if he wasnt, they would have stayed as a pack of three, rather than split as a pack of two and a pack of one
for their trinkets, her father gave her the coin for her first trinket. She proceeded to mark her coin, her trinket, with a triangle at one side and three lines in the other. Later, when her father got a new trinket for himself, he marked it first, and then asked his daughter to add another mark for him. She added a triangle. 
once a duga realizes a loved one has passed, they forget them, as such, she no longer knows it was her father that taught her the funeral ritual. as part of the teaching, she had to repeated to herself, as when the memory of her father is gone, so would have been the lesson. that is why she know how to perform the ritual but doesn't know how she knows it. later in her life, she will realize the mechanics of dugan selective amnesia, and teach her own children in a manner so that the lesson survives the amnesia.
