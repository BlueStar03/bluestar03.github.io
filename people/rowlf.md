## Working Notes

This is a description of a race of people that live in the world of Threa, the Rowlf.

The Rowlf appearance can be mistaken for a canine animal. they are quadruped with four fingered paws. They have thick tails and floppy ears, which end in a tuff of black fur. Their bodies are covered in fur with a variety of colors and patterns.  Their eye colors can be blues, greens, and oranges. They wear clothing that is unique to quadrupedal bodies. Their vocal range is limited, for example they are unable to pronounce the letter I. As such they prefer writing to communicate, carrying a chalkboard with them.

They have no nation or society of themselves to speak of. They do the best of what they can wherever they are. There are three broad populations that are determined on how they interact with other races. The largest are the commoners. not much different than any other race but can be considered second class citizens. their animal appearance and inability to communicate effectively make it hard for them to assert themselves. If they are wronged, they take the loss and move one. They may also find themselves dependent on others to perform tasks that are harder to perform for a quadruped. The next category are the Pets. They are effectively slaves. owned by some master and are used for tasks that otherwise be done by a beast of burden. of particular note are those who serve as pets, like a dog. They live with some degree of luxury, but subservient to their master.  The third are the Wilds. they basically live out in the wild, outside any society or norm. organized as packs, similar to wolves. They hunt, live in caves and burrows. Every so often they may need to trade with other races for things like tools and clothing. 

Rowlf that are held as pets may find it hard to transition to either of the two other populations. for one, they are being cared for, like how someone care for a horse or a cat. Their owner makes any arrangements for their wellbeing, so when they find themselve without an owner, They really don't know what to do to take care of themselve. and interesting note, is when their owner gives them a name they themselves are unable to pronounce. for example, the name "Fifi" is unpronounceable for a Rowlf, leaving them unable to even introduce themselves.

an ownerless pet may shed their unpronounceable name to a new one. but this is hard step to make since it would basically discard their old identity. it is easy if their life as pets was full of hardship. but if they were loved pat of the family, they may not be ready to discard that part of themselves just yet. especially if their owner's family had prestige. 

Rwolf names are just a singular personal name. They are two syllables. Roro, Roru, Rofu, Mufu, Grufo and Lulu are a few examples. The first vowel determines if its a male or female name. O for males, U for females. Pets are named by their owners, so they may not follow this convention. in fact, they may receive names that a rwolf cannot pronounce, like Max, Bella or Fifi. Sounds they cant replicate include the  vowels A and I, and the consonants, B C D K P Q V W X

an interesting relationship Rowlfs, both Pets and commoners, have are with Zeur male. Like them, Zeur males are treated as second class citizen and are used for various labor task that would otherwise be done by beast of burden. Rowlfs find themselves employed alongside male Zeur. They form a deep comradeship. additionally, Zeurs may provide a sense of security because of their immense size and strength. in turn, Zeur male find companionship they would otherwise not have.

Their weapon of choice is a curved knife. The limited dexterity from their paws makes it hard to handle weapons and tools with finesse. instead, they use their mouth to grip their weapons and tools. the curved knife is the best weapon they can use   when gripped by their mouths. Wilds use it quite effectively for hunting. it is not uncommon for Rowlf to carry both a chalkboard and a curve knife secured on each of their hindlegs. Pets don't carry either item
