# Kapopa  

![Kapopa Design Study](/images/kapopa_design_study.jpg "Kapopa Design Study")  

## Appearance

Their appearance is quite unusual. Their skin is covered in fur-like feathers, which come in a wide variety of patterns and colors. Their eyes can be light blue, green, or red-orange, and they have large, sturdy ears. Their head features a crest of feathers, with one feather in the center being a different color than the rest. They possess a wolf-like head with a beak-like snout and have an unusual body structure that includes two torsos, resulting in three pairs of limbs.  

The top pair of arms, emerging from their upper torso, are muscular with five-fingered hands. The mid limbs, from their second torso, have four-toed paws similar to those of real-world lions. The hind legs, originating from their hip, are equipped with three-toed talons. Their standard posture is quadrupedal, walking on their hind legs and mid limbs. They typically stand at an average height of 5 to 6 feet. However, when standing upright on their hind legs, they can reach a towering height of 10 to 12 feet. Their mid limbs have limited dexterity and can perform simple tasks while standing upright. Additionally, they have long tail feathers that match the color of their crest feathers.  

## Culture

They have a nomadic, hermit-like lifestyle and live deep in the woods, away from almost everything. It is easy to tell if a Kapopa lives nearby due to the presence of wooden statues. Kapopas are master woodworkers and hone their skills throughout their lives.  
Although they do not fully isolate themselves, they offer their woodworking skills to anyone in exchange for enough sustenance. No project is too humble for them, but they prefer challenging tasks that test their skills, such as creating ornate mansions. Additionally, they migrate to different forests to experience various types of wooden materials.

Kapopa travel extensively across various regions, either as solitary males or accompanied by their spouses and children. Male children depart from their families upon reaching maturity, while female children remain with their families until marriage, after which they relocate to join their husbands. Only when widowed do they embark on journeys alone. 
Kapopa typically settle in unclaimed land within forested areas where they construct cabins for living and working purposes. They engage in hunting, gathering, and producing what they require, while trading for additional necessities. Local populations may seek out Kapopa settlements once they become aware of their presence nearby. The Kapopa stay for several years before eventually dismantling their cabins and leaving the area in its natural state, save for a few wooden statues they leave behind. Following this period, they may either seek another forested location or embark on a pilgrimage to the Heartwood Haven. 

The Kapopa people consider the Heartwood Haven, a remote forested area inland as their closest equivalent to a nation. They make multiple pilgrimages to this forest throughout their lives. Although there are no permanent residents, there is always a Kapopa presence in the forest. During these gatherings, they engage in learning, teaching, socializing with fellow Kapopa, and finding partners.
