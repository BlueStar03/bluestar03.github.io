## Working Notes

This is a description of a race of people that live in the world of Threa, the Lor.

The Lor are a group of people that have vast kingdoms throughout the land. They live under a harsh patriarchy. Their kingdoms are headed by a king. The aristocracy administers his rule. They have vast armies, and lowly peasantry.

on their physical appearance. They have four digits on their hands and feet. Their fingertips are pointed. They have skin covered horns on top of their heads. Their skin color ranges from various tints and shades of red, pink, orange and magenta. Their hair and eyes are vibrant reds and oranges, and rarely yellow. As they age, their hair darkens to black. The sclera of their eyes is black. Males tend to be taller than females. Males tend to approach 7ft tall, and females average 4.5ft. Peasant females tend to be taller than noble females. Nobel males tend to be shorter than peasant males, due to leisure and overindulgence. Militant, which are only male, tend to be the tallest. In general, they have a slim, lanky build. Militant and Laborers can develop muscular builds. The leisure and overindulgences lifestyle of the aristocracy contributes to a plumper build, more common with males than females. 

Their "horns" are bones underneath them with stretched skin over. They come in two varieties, outward or upward. A sharp point tends to indicate a healthy, strong, well feed person. Tall horns also indicate the person's healthy upbringing. Tall and sharp points contribute to their attractiveness. Overfeeding and overindulgence, like it is common with aristocrat males, tends to round the point. Other reasons that tend to round, blunt, and shorten the horns are malnutrition, starvation, stress, and overall hardships during their upbringing. The bone can crack and can be seen through the skin. The horn can completely break off as well. this may indicate a past significant trauma. A cracked horn never heals, a broken horn will never grow back. While it varies by individual, some feel pride of their damaged horn, some incredible tale in which they were victorious. But more commonly, it is viewed with some level of shame. that some failure from their part lead to the damage or loss of their horn. May be viewed as somewhat disabled. 

one aspect about Lor patriarchy is that women are effectively owned by their husbands. The traditional trinket that wives wear are shackles. Peasant wives wear simple wood and rope shackles on either their ankles or their wrist. richer wives were more elaborate and ornate shackles with long metal chains on both their ankles and wrist. they are not necessary viewed in a negative way. They are akin to wedding rings. it is common for some peasants to save up to buy a good shackle, with a bit of metal, so they may propose to their sweetheart. Female identity is tied to their husbands. They are referred to as the storekeeper's wife, or Jora's Wife and not by their name. if not married, they are refered by a close male relation, the farmers sister, the soldier's mother, Alim's daughter.  Peasants do tend to be more egalitarian. female peasants do contribute to their community, can be more open and expressive with their opinions, but men still hold power over them.  Aristocratic men exert their power over the women in their family, a quiet wife is a good wife.

The lor have vast armies. serving at the pleasure of the king. they are usesd for territorial control and stability, guards and law enforcement, territory defence and expansion, and to challenge other kings and kingdoms. Only males are conscripted. They wear minimal armor. mostly worn under decorative tunics. a distinct piece of armor are their pauldrons. a solid piece of metal that covers their shoulders and back and part of their chest. they tend to be gold in color, using pyrite for the effect. They may have ornaments too. Their weapon of choice are Razors. A Lor Razor is a large, curved piece of metal in which all their side sharpened. A small handle is embedded inside the curve so that it may be gripped and manuvered. The curved edge resembles real world scimitars.

pessant are consipted into the military, they are trained and payid well. if they survive the campaign, they return with not only their pay, but also any loot they carry. The conscript may choose to remain in the army, eventually becoming a veteran. a mentor and trainer that provides guidance, and very capable and experienced fighters. However, command remains with the king and the aristocracy. on their whim, they can grab a battalion for whatever campaign they want. some aristocrats may choose to remain in command, becoming generals.

raditions and Customs: What are some unique traditions, festivals, or ceremonies that the Lor observe? How do these practices differ between the aristocracy and peasants?

Lor aristocracy love to declare days of celebration, which contribute to their overindulgence. They may declare meaningless celebration, just because they want to. Like the anniversary of when they got their favorite steed. Sometime the peasant welcomes it, a rest from their work. Sometimes they despise it, there is work to be done. Peasant have their on festivities, like harvest day and Summer solstice. Militants also hold days of honor for various campaigns and generals and honor soldiers. 

Aristocrats families tend to be the male head of the household, his wife and children, and his side wives and their illegitimate children. Only his main wife her children are legitimate. The children being his heirs. Males can have multiple wives, but the side wives and her children are of are basically peasants. The main wife having ornate shackles, while the side wives have polished metal shackles. The main wife must be aritocratic born. but the side wives can be peasants.
Peasant males can have multiple wives but it is harder financially. And all have equal legitimacy. Because of high mortality among the peasants, many families are mixed, adopted. A common practice is for orphan children to sell their deceased parent’s possession to and to offer as payment to the family that adopts them. So a peasant family consist of the male head of the house, his wives, though typically just one, and the family’s children. Their mother is unimportant, as they all are his children. His wife will care for them. Both his offspring and adopted. And a remarried female and the children of her late husband. And wives and children can be abandoned, in which they will seek another family to be adopted.
Militants also can have multiple wives, and a few high ranking do, but they self limit to two. And they also all have equal legitimacy. So it is the Militant, His wives and his children, both offspring and adopted. the father does identify the mother of his children. any adopted children is adopted by one of his wives. still all of his wives still care for all his children, regardless of the mother.

in the aristocratic family, the father only identifies the mother of his legitimate offspring, his main wife is only responsible for her own.  his side wives are responsible not only for his illegitimate children but also his main wives children as well, and adopted children, if any. However, side wives act under the direction of the main wife. The father may choose to legitimize any of his illegitimate children. which then will become the main wife responsibility. the father cannot delegitimize. 
peasants don't identify the mother, but the mothers do keep track of their own children.
militants do identify the mother, and all are legitimate. adopted children are considered the children of one of the wives. Both wives share responsibility for all his children. both wives wear shackles of equal prestige. 

in an aristocratic family, if the father dies, his main wife and her children can go to the father’s closest male family, like their father, brother or uncle. another option is for the eldest son to take over. if the son is not yet old enough, his mother, the main wife, may administer her late husband’s estate until the son is old enough to do so. Whomever gains control of the estate, can choose to retain the side wives and their respective children. If they are not retained, each wife, with their own children, may seek to remarry. Any illegitimate adopted children may be taken by any side wives, legitimized by the next male kin or eldest son, or seek to be adopted on their own. If the main wife passes, her children are still legitimate. The father may choose a side wife to become his main wife, which has to be of aristocratic birth, seek a new main wife, or remain a widower. If a side wife passes, her children are treated like adopted children, and can be abandon. The father may choose to get another side wife or not. 
for a peasant family, if the father passes, the eldest son may take over, if old enough. Otherwise, each wife takes her own children with them, and any adopted if the wish. They may seek to remarry together with her children. The most common approach however is for either the eldest son or each wife, to have each member adopted separately to different family, as the strain to adopt even one wife and her children would be to much for most families. If any of the wives passes, the father may choose to get a new wife or not. children can be abandoned to lighten the load.
for militant families, if the father passes, either the eldest son if old enough, or the two wives assume control over the family and  the estate. The two wives may choose to remain together or split, remarry together or individually or remain widowed. If a wife passes, he may choose to remained widowed, or seek a new wife. The children of the passed wife will go to the new one. 

in one occasion. A peasant family of 9 The Father, his one wife, and their seven children, including a newborn. The father died in a construction accident. The eldest son assumed control of the family. Their mother however, was sick and passed away soon after. The eldest son, Limarl, could not maintain the family. So he sold all of their possession. He bought a cart and a beast to pull it. The room they occupied was used as payment for the newborn sibling. He then split the money he had in four, their four youngest siblings. They traveled from town to town, in order to have each of the four youngest siblings adopted in peasant families. At the end it was just him and the eldest daughter, Sania. Limarls plan was to sell the cart and beast, and split the proceed with Sania. However, he decided to give all the procedds to her, so that she may be adopted by an aristocratic family. Limarl then kept going, he was eventally adopted by a militant family.

Peasant children have the same opportunities as any other peasant, labor, service, domestic, jobs. Males can become soldiers. Females are encouraged to marry young. And to remarry as soon as possible. They are encouraged to always be under a male’s protection, their fathers, husbands, or sons. There are still unmarried and widowed females, and it is harder for them to remain like that.

for militant families, technically they are peasants, since they are conscripted from peasants. Their children can enlist themselves, or seek any peasant opportunity. Daughter are encouraged to find militant husbands, rather than peasants. Especially from the aristocratic officer corps. But they can also remain with their mothers. Unmarried and widowed females are common, and it may actually carry some honor to remain like that depending on the honor of their father, late husband. as it is preferable to remain unmarried or widowed, retaining the link to their father, late husband with a high honor status, than to marry, remarry to someone with less honor. Daughters receive a modest dowry.

Aristocratic children are divided based on their lineage. Aristocratic born legitimate children can pursue any aristocratic station. Administrators, governance, ownership, officer corps, and enlighten (high education) stations They also have full claim to their father’s estate. Depending on the father, priority by age, even split, or the eldest son having a larger share. Daughter receive a dowry. The eldest daughter may receive a larger dowry. Aristocratic born Illegitimate have the same employment opportunities, but no claim to the father’s estate, unless there are no legitimate claims. Daughters receive a smaller dowry. Peasant born legitimate have claims on their father’s estate. Daughters receive a dowry, but have no access to any aristocratic station outside of their fathers. Otherwise they revert to peasants. Thou it is common for them to remain in service to aristocrats. Peasant born illegitimate children remain peasants. No aristocratic opportunities. Again, many remain as servants to aristocrats. Daughters receive no dowry. If they go back to peasant population, having an aristocratic father may give them some prestige.

Economic Activities: What are the primary industries or sources of wealth for the Lor kingdoms? Do they engage in trade, agriculture, craftsmanship, or other economic activities?
Lor kingdoms are vast and numerous. While a single town or even a kingdom may focus of a single economic output, the totality of the Lor economy spans into all areas. Exept one. They are not sea fearing. As such they have no maritime presence. They depend on others for marine resources.

Social Mobility: Is there any possibility for individuals, especially peasants, to rise in social status? How rigid is the class structure? Virtually none. Peasants are peasants and aristocrats are aristocrats. Even a destitute aristocrat has more privileges than a wealthy Peasant. For females, the most they can achieve is being an aristocrat’s side wife. Yet they are not aristocrat themselves, and her children are born peasants. They enjoy as much privilege as her aristocrat husband allows. For a male, if a peasant born male, is legitimized by his aristocrat father, and makes a claim on his father’s estate. Then he can have a main wife, an aristocratic female, and his children will be born aristocrats. even a peasant born, legitimized, with a successful claim, exercising his father office, they are still peasants. if they misstep, they can loose it all, and destroy his fathers lineage in the processes. This is the only path for a peasant born to have aristocrat children. For militant, the officer corps are all aristocrats, and the warrior corps are all peasant. Being part of the militant class does afford greater privileges than the peasant, but can still be discharge in dishonor. The officers will remain aristocrats even in dishonor. They just wont enjoy the additional privileges the militant class affords them

Military Technology: Besides the Lor Razor and pauldrons, do the Lor utilize any unique technologies or tactics in their military? Not really. They are middle of the road in all aspects. But it is their sheer numbers that make their armies overpowering. They do have siege artillery, trebuchet, ballistas, cannons and mortars. In terms of tactics, there isn much. The sheer numbers approach will provide victory to even an incompetent general. So they don’t get to be challenged. Few officer care about their troops, but most just go into the officer corps to receive honor. Their units will eventually succeed. The enemy will get tired from the overwhelming numbers. Peasants are expendable.

Training and Hierarchy: How is military training conducted, and what is the hierarchy within the army? Are there specialized roles or units? The militant class is their professional army. They train, march and spar regularly, but combat is where the learn the most. The militant class consisting of the peasant Warrior Corp and the aristocrat Officer Core. The warrior core consist of the basic foot soldier. They form the bulk of their armies. A proven soldier may be promoted to a corporal. They carry command responsibilities. An honorable corporal can be promoted to a Knight, the highest of the Warrior ranks. The officer corp consist of captains, commanders and generals. The captains promote warriors. The king and his nobles promote the officers. In terms of units, they have basic infantry, cavalry, archers and artillery. One additional unit is the royal guard, composed exclusively of knights.

Presence of Magic: Does magic exist in the world of Threa, and if so, how do the Lor interact with or utilize it? Are there mages or magical traditions within their society?
There is magic, but it is largely unknown so it plays very little in Lor society. The Lor are creations of Fire an can innately control fire, they just don’t know. Very rarely someone discovers this ability but the inability to study and explain it cause that they can teach it to anyone. One prominent use thou is healing. Lor medicine is lacking. Like fire, the lor can easily inflict damage, but has a hard time healing it. Lor medics are of por quality, to the point that they prefer to import medics from other races than use their own. Every so often, however, someone who has discovered fire magic, and has spent significant time mastering it, discover fire’s superb healing capabilities. A healing fire they call white glow. Superior to even the best medical teams, these healers travel around and offer these services. Many form a following, yet other hold that they are charlatans, there is no way the broken bones magically healed. by the time these healers have mastered white glow, they are already entering old age. they lack the time and ability to even train a second generation. additionally, they only end up spending no more than a decade practicing before the pass away. [DESIGN NOTE] these healers are viewed in similar manner as Jesus like messianic figure. the sudden appearance and then disappearance of a great healer. this will lead to stories about these past healer that walked this lands, especially from their followers. who may insist that these great healers may return. which ends up being correct since some one else will rediscover how to use White Glow

Mythology and Legends: What myths or legends are significant to the Lor? Do they have creation stories or heroic tales that shape their cultural identity? various kingdoms and regions have their own stories, but it is not unified. There are multiple variations with the great healer stories. There are local legends of local heroes and figures. one common one involves a gladiator standing up to a king. Another common story involves who the wrorld formed by spewing out from a volcano. which volcano changes depending on where the story is being told, either a nearby volcano, a fictional one, or the one that sits in the mightiest of their kingdoms.

Religious Practices: What religions or belief systems do the Lor follow? Are there specific deities, rituals, or spiritual practices that are central to their society?
Impact on Society: How do these beliefs influence their laws, governance, and daily life?
Their beliefs are varied. Some are small sects, others span multiple kingdoms, single deity, twin deities, multiple deities. Still present, long gone, sealed away. In some kingdoms, their laws come from their faiths, in others they are separate. One commonality is that in kingdoms that have volcanos nearby. There are beliefs that revolve on those volcanos. That the volcanoes are the deity, the home of the deity or a product of the deity actions. In one the local volcano is the last place the deity stood before leaving. In another, is that the eruptions are the deity trying to escape. One kingdom with three volcanoes has stories that volcanoes themselves are the deities protecting them.

Landscapes: What is the geography of Threa like, particularly the regions where the Lor reside? Are there distinct landscapes (mountains, forests, deserts) that influence their lifestyle and architecture?the lands under Lor rule are vast. A fair number of kingdom are near volcanoes, but not all. From woodlands to deserts and open fields. Two types of lands that the Lor don’t have dominion over are cold areas and areas with a lot of water, like humid areas, coastal areas or any waterside regions. It is hard for them to survive when it is too cold or if there is a lot of water. They prefer hot and dryer areas.  

Resources: What natural resources are abundant or scarce in Lor territories, and how do these affect their economy and military capabilities? Having a vast variety of land, they have a variety of resources. Timber, stone, metals, gems, precious metals, livestock, farms. They produce a surplus that they make available for export. Some of the few thing they don’t have access are fish and marine products, and water navigation and transport. In some regions they have to import water. Not because it is scare, but it is to dangers for them to access it. Also some varieties of stone, metals, and wood not present in their territories. 
one interesting agricultural practice is lava farming. They themselves can touch lava, and have figured out how to make certain crops fire resistant, so they can grow on pools of lava.

The Lor have a variety of relationships with other races and with other lor kingdoms. War, peace, alliances, isolation and open trade. For most of their history they have been expansionist, taking land from others. Today may border kingdoms are actually mixed, preferring coexistence. But inland kingdoms keep pushing for expansion, even warring with other Lor kingdoms. One interesting alliance is with the Dis Com people. In exchange for land, the Dis Com will answer any Call to Arms they request. And the Dis Com have among the best military. Only the worst general would dare send armies against the Dis Com. And their soldier would prefer to disobey that order than fight the Dis Com. There are a few Desert kingdoms that trade agreement with the dessert Frills. The Frills would mine water and metals for the Lor in exchange for crops.  The Lor also export Lava to the underwater race Ma Hir, in exchange for marine products.
the Kingdoms near the Hospitable Redn nation, Lor or otherwise, trade protection for exchange of Redn crops. even against other lor kingdoms.
The Aria and the Murai, two other expansionist races, are typical opponents to the Lor. Often conquering, loosing and reclaiming each other’s territories. It is not uncommon for the Lor to have prejudicial views against them.

Cultural Exchange: Is there any cultural exchange or influence from other groups, or are the Lor largely insular? Many border kingdoms are mixed, in which many different races are part of it. Some are still Lor lead, other have mixed leadership. These kingdoms serve as hubs of cultural exchange, both out and into Lor culture. Additionally, any lands the Lor have lost, retain some aspect of Lor culture that was there during their occupation. 

Language: Do the Lor have their own language or dialects? How sophisticated is their written and oral communication? The land of Threa have speak 4 languages. The Lor speak one of them. They have many dialects. The aristocrats have a few “Enlighten” dialects, the peasants have many “vulgar” regional dialects farmers, miner and artisans have their own as well, Militants have one “operational” dialect, with a bit of differences between warriors and officers. [IRL tangent, the four languages will be represented by English, Spanish, Japanese and yet to be decided. The actual language used will depend on localization]

All aristocrats are literate, most Militants are literate, only soldier rank are illiterate, most peasant are illiterate, merchants, clerks, ministers, peasant children of aristocrats and a few other are among the few literate peasants. Border kingdoms have a diversity of dialects and include influence from other cultures.

Symbols and Art: What forms of art, literature, or symbols are important in Lor culture? Lor art is varied, but not the best available. There are other races that produce superior art. Still, the peasant, militant and aristocrats use art differently. An interesting insight can be view in marriage shackles. Peasant are very utilitarian, mainly made of wood and rope, with more affluent peasants seeking cast metal shackles. Nonetheless, the tend to have simple patterns for decoration. Militant are made from metals. Warriors polished theirs and Officers are polished by the artisan. They are decorated with the record of their husbands honor. Some officers also add precious metals to highlight certain honors. Aristocrats have ornate shackles made of polished metals or precious metals. They have gems and trims. The chains are also more elaborate. The most prestigious metal is Azure metal, like gold but blue hued, worn by the nobles and the king.
A common motif found across Lor art, specially to address royalty, is a specific fire design, a flame with three licks. While there are plenty of variant, it is clear that this design has a common origin

The three licked fire symbol derives form an artifact created by Fire himself that was worn the be early kings, Fire's Ring.  The jewel on the ring has that form. today, the ring is lost, as too is the history of the early kings.

Founding Myths: How did the Lor establish their kingdoms? Are there significant historical events or figures that shaped their current society?
The establishment of Lor is long forgotten. No Lor knows that information. Fire created the Lor however, he did not what the newly created Lor to know that. He tasked the Aetha and the Dreavi, Two races that were created before Lor, to care for the Lor. The Dreavi and Aetha then took the shape of the Lor and assume parental roles to them. They taught the lor what they needed to thrive . all this happened in a volcano. the Aetha and Dreavi left the lor to shape their own futures. As there populations grew, the sought more lands, establishe new settlement that grew into kingdoms. they met other races, there was peace for a time. Many races coexisted, but then war broke that covered the entire world. At the end of this war is when historical records are accurate. Anything during and before that war is prone to be inaccurate. There are many false stories and legacies that help embellish the current Kings. The story of the gladiator standing up against a king is based on a real event that happen shortly before the great war broke out. But today there are many variations of that story, and various kings and nobles claim to be a decendat of the gladiator. The volcano that was the cradle of the Lor is still in lor territory, but it is inside a small kingdom, unaware of it legacy.
