## Working Notes

This is a description of a race of people that live in the world of Threa, the Murai.

The Murai are Warrior society. each person has a role not just during times of peace, but also during war

on there appearance, their skin color ranges between pale and dim reds and purples, their hair and eye color are deep reds, dark reds. with rare oranges and golden yellow. they have a receding hairline. their hair clumps into five points, one on top of their head and two on each side.  they may style their hair using those five points. like cutting the top point, or tying two adjacent points together. they have pointed ears. because of their active lifestyle, it is common for them to have lean, muscular build. 

each Murai has a dual role, one relating to peacetime, know as Concord, and the other relating to wartime, know as Discord.  The labor class in Concord are the main infantry class in Discord. the merchants deal with logistics. the administrators and governors form the command structure during Discord. scribes and poets in Concord, carry orders and communication duties. artisans serve as armorers

of particular note is their armor. Second only to Dis Com Heavy armor. Murai armor comes in three grades. each is defined by the amount of skill needed to wield it and the amount of Azure metal used. Azure is a precious metal. similar to Gold, with the difference being that Azure is blue, not yellow. its use in any armament seems perplexing because as a soft metal, it will easily deform from being hit. This is were the skill of the Murai comes into play. Murai know how to imbue items with lifeforce. Murai can then use this lifeforce reserve to enhance their own properties, becoming faster, stronger, harder. The can use the lifeforce to tank more hits.Azure metal can gold more lifeforce than any other material.  Valiant grade armor has minimal use of Azure, relying more on hard metals like iron and steel. Victor grade armors have around 50 percent azure, allowing the warrior to have acces to a larger reserve of lifeforce. it also has increase coverage of the body. Noble grade armors are nearly entirely made of Azure metal. their bodies are fully covered, giving them the highest reserve of lifeforce possible

Part of maintaining their armor is to restore any expended lifeforce. the easiest way is to pour blood onto the armor. and it is even easier if the wielders own blood is use. The wielder taps into the lifeforce already within the blood and transfers it into the armor. it is more effective if the wielder uses their own, familiar blood and lifeforce, than someone else. but they can still extract some nonetheless. they typically slit their wrist and let about one third of their blood floow unto the armor. this leaves the wielder weak and must recover. the wielder can repeat the session until the armor is full. a depleted armor is considered dead and will take more blood than otherwise in order to revive it.  Skilled wielders can transfer the lifeforce straight into the armor, without using blood as the intermediary. They can also use the lifeforce of their oppenent if they draw their blood. it would not be as efficient but is a helpfull skill.

The weapon of choice for the Murai are Shields. efective uses can deal high amounts of blunt damage, while further bolstering the armors defenses. Murai Shields are mounted on the armor's bracers. Murai Shields come in variety of shapes, but by far the most common shape ends in a point in front of the hands. some varieties have embedded blades. one in particular is the sparing shield. it is large and heavy round shield. Its increased defense is meant to protect the wielder during sparing session, and its heaviness hinders mobility. some however have found that with training, Sparing Shields can be used effectively in combat. especially it can provide ranged capabilities since it can be thrown like a disk.

Murai are egalitarian. there are few impositions placed upon the individual based on their gender. any and all role are available to anyone as long as they can demonstrate their capabilities.

Murai maintain two sets of clothing. their Concord cloth is what they wear every day. Commoners use sturdy materials for their shirts, coats, hats, pants and boots. Nobles use finer materials with intricate decorations for their shirts, coats, hats, pants and boots. females may also adorn their hair with ribbons. their Discord cloth is their armor. they maintain it during Concord so it will be ready to wield when Discord starts.














Murai are an egalitarian warrior society. They have three merit based classes are Valiant ranks , Sentinel ranks and Nobles ranks. Valiants are the labor during peace and general troops during war. Sentinel are administrators and police during peace, and deal with logistics and low level command during war. The Nobles deal with governance in peace and with command and elite forces during war. movement a thru the classes is fluid. They are born into the lower rank of their parents, when they come of age, they may choose to go to any lower class rank. by merit and valor, they advance to higher ranks. the highest rank is the ArchNoble
