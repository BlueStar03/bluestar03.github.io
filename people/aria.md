## Working Notes

This is a description of a race of people that live in the world of Threa, the Aria.

The Aria have vast kingdoms ruled by Queens. They are matriarchal, with women present in all aspects of their society, and males are expected to be subservient to females. A quiet husband is a good husband.

on their appearance, their skin color ranges with various tints and shades of light pink, lilac and mauve. their hair and eye colors in bright purples and magentas. their hair parts into two points, reminiscent to a jester hat or a barn swallow's tail. Their hair is a bit stiff. their nose is straight and solid. They have flat forearms and hands, with five feather-like fingers. they have pointed ears. they can naturally levitate. they rearely touch the ground. They wear flowy and loose clothing, like sleeveless shirt, belts, wraps, sashes, bell-bottom pants, jester hats, cloth shoes. they also wear a wide variety of capes. colors of their clothing range from various pastel colors, with some vibrant colors for accent. Blacks and darker colors are reserved for military attire. They also wrap their hair in decorative ribbons. 

The Aria can naturally levitate, it does require effort, but not much different than other comparable actions. hovering about their foot's length above the ground is the same just standing. moving about at that height is the same as walking. Moving faster is like running. Moving up is like walking uphill. As long as they have stamina, they can keep climbing. they can remain at the same height as if they were just standing.  If they tire themselves out, they may fall to the ground.

Their kingdoms tend to be ontop of flat top mountains. giving then good defence, since only those that can fly or float can reach their kingdoms with ease. the more impressive kingdoms are actually built in the clouds. Aria can forge fluffy but sturdy material that can float. building artificial clouds. The lands where the shadow of their cloud falls, are also claimed as their territory. These areas are the most accessible for the other races. 

Because their kingdoms are highly inaccessible, they don't field a large military force. Only their shadowlands are vulnerable to external forces. The few military forces they have focus on covert operations, surveillance, espionage, sabotage, and assassination. This is ideal as their bodies don't develop muscular builds easily, placing them at a disadvantage in direct combat.  Their weapon of choice are boomerang blades, sharpened and curved metal that can be thrown and returns to the wielder. Their armor consists of hardened capes, to preserve mobility.

These kingdoms come in two kinds. those who settle on top of mesas, flat top mountains. Those are Topland Kingdoms. The second kind build their kingdoms in the sky from cloudlike materials. These are Cloudland Kingdoms. Both provide good defenses, since only those that can fly or float can reach their kingdoms with ease. Aria can forge fluffy but sturdy material that can float. building artificial clouds, cloudcrete. topland kingdoms also use cloudcrete but not as widely. cloudcrete is used to extend the edge of the mesa. The lands where the shadow of their cloud falls, are also claimed as their territory, the shadowlands either from the entirety of the cloudlands, or the extended edge of the toplands. These areas are the most accessible for the other races, either trade or invasion. 

while aria females may have a husband. This bond is temporary.  only existing to provide a female with a child. fathers play no role in the child's life. in fact, they are fully unknown. No Aria knows who their father is. The mother alone raises their children. they solely care and provide for their children.

The basic family unit consists of the wife, her husband, and their children. The wife is the head of the household and the bread winner. The husband is the homemaker. The husband is more involved in raising their children than the wife. Daughters are viewed with more value than sons. Daughters carry on the family, sons become part of their wife's family. Firstborn daughters enjoy certain privileges that the other siblings don't, like inheritance and title priority.



1. Queens and various other nobility titles are inherited by the firstborn female, typically. extraneous circumstances may cause for the title to be inherited outside the line of succession
2. There are four main castes, the Nobles, either born into or adopted. the Peasants which every one else is born. females can advance to clergy, which are administrator, scribes, record keepers, librarians and bookkeeping. females can also be abducted into the military. 
3. All males are born peasants.the perform many menial task, like cleaning, cooking, farming, etc. one sough after post is that of a major domo. the effectively run the household of a female. while female can choose any male to father their child, major domos are more sought after. Male children are given to the major domo, effectively cutting ties with their mother. they may be kept in the household or taken to another one. they are collectively raise by the servitude of the household.

4. Female child are raised by their mothers alone. depending if their born peasant or noble, their experience will be different, from schooling to available jobs. male children are given to the major domo, or equivalent male that runs the mothers household. the major domo may keep or give the child away. wherever they end up, the servitude of the household, both male and female, raises the male child.
5. a female may court any male they wish. even multiple males at the same time. while the female is courting the male, they may be referred as husbands. The female may end the courship at any time. typically when they get bored, or become pregnant. when the female gets pregnant, all courtship stops. thus a males time as husband ends. the female never assumes the title of wife.

female peasants can study and apply to become clergy. the studying is demanding. preparing them for various entrance exams. each advancement within the clergy is receive after passing various test. they also are subject to various audits. They effectively serve as the bureaucracy of their nation. from accounting, book keeping, taxation, and anything that maintains accurate records. the entire caste is fully literate. this positions, while arduous, do have their perks. From better social standing. better financial state, to having limited power and influence, especially if the serve a noble. 

Peasant and clergy are abducted into the military. some nobles as well. current is structure in to main operations, Thunders and Zephyrs. The thunder ops are the lower of the two. they are they perform visible duties, such as policing and guarding. they wear uniforms that distinguish their role. The Zephyr Ops perform covert operations, from surveillance to assassination. they don't wear any specific uniform, blending into the population. Zephyr masters anwner only to the queen. they maintain surveillance of the population, and select perspective recruits. they have to be absolutely sure that the perspective recruit will succeed, for their failure means their death. the recruit is kidnapped and trained. once they successfully join Zephyr ops, they return to their previous office, which is now a front to their covert operations. they may also end up joining Thunders. Aria can also enlist, conscript or draft Thunders.

The zephyrs are virtually unknown. there are, however, rumors of their existence. some are true. most are false. Zephyrs themselves push many of the rumors. as such, the thunders are the only military that are in the public perception. still, most thunder chiefs are zephyrs themselves, so thunders are directly under zephyr control.

Zephir roles are compartmentalized. most agents are only aware of the tasks they carry. it is not uncommon for multiple zephyrs be present, surveying the same area, and be unaware that they are observing another zephyr. their report may include another zephyr. Only masters and few others know the entire situation.

there are three main roles that any given zephyr may have, Agents, Contacts, and Masters. Agents are the once who perform any given covert operation. there are three classes of agents, Monitors, Spies, and Assassins. Monitor just survey their assignment, either a place, a building or a person. They observe and report. they are advise to retreat rather than use lethal force if compromised. Spies can perform monitor tasks, as well as infiltration, interrogation, sabotage, and theft. They can use lethal force if needed, but it is best to avoid to do so. Assassins can perform all the task of a spy, their primary task is to terminate their target. they are free to use lethal force at their discretion. 
Contacts are different than agents. all comunications go theu them, reports and assignments between agents and masters. they are only aware of the agents they are meant to communicate with and their one master. Thunder Chiefs are in touch with a contact to provide reports and receive orders. Agent don't have training as contacts, and contacts don't have training as agents. Masters are experts in all fields. they answer directly to the Queen and anyone she may assigned them to. Masters use many Contacts to receive reports and issue orders. they make any and all decisions with only the queen being able to overrule them, they basically are the generals of the aria military. They are aware of the identity of all their contacts and agents. queens employ multiple masters to operate in different regions.

A master makes the decision to add either an agent or a contact. they review their reports to identify potential recruits. further surveillance is assigned to monitors on the potential recruits to narrow down their choice. It is at the Master's discretion who they choose, however, sings of loyalty and little to no family are preferred. once a decision is made, a spy is sent to kidnap the recruit. and assignment is sent to the local thunder chief to disregard the kidnapping, either downplay or conduct a phony investigation.  The recruit is brought before a junior master to train them as monitors or contacts. if the recruit is unable to be trained, they are terminated to maintain the secrecy of the zephyr. once the recruit becomes a zephyr, they are returned to their previous office. with the local thunder chief helping in the cover up. they will be assign to a contact so they may perform their duties as a zephyr. 

At tbe Masters discretion, they may advance a monitor into a spy,  and afterwards into an assassin. If the master sees potential on the Zephyr to become a Master, they are trained in the other role,  agent or contact. Once the Zephyr is an expert as both agents and contacts, then they will be inducted as a junior Master. Once they have experience as a junior Master, including training new recruits, will they become Grand Masters 

When a thunder becomes a Thunder Chief, there is a ceremony and celebration. part of that involves a meeting with the outgoing chief and a contact. the outgoing chief, or someone with authority if unavailable, instructs the new chief to consider any and all correspondence with the contact as if they are the words of the queen. if she gets instructions to have a guard relived early, to leave a door unlocked, to conclude and investigation, they best do so. there are Monitors embedded within the thunder chief forces, providing reports of her to the master. 

a monitor may not have an assignment at all. they just go on with their lives. at any time a contact may issue them a assignment. usually it is something that may not need much accommodation from the monitors part. maybe is a person that frequents their shop, someone they may pass by in their day, or just a report on the current situation of their area. depending on what is being reported, it could just be reported the color of the ribbon they wear on the day of the report, or which candles are lit. sometimes a poem or shopping list encodes the report, or a coded conversation between the monitor and the contact. there are times however that accuracy is important and an unencoded report is written. such sensitive information may be retrieve covertly by the contact, or delivered to a dead drop. The assignment may continue until otherwise instructed.

Spies are activated for tasks outside a monitors skill. they may be needed to infiltrate a building or travel far away, including into foreign lands, or have contact with the target, interrogation, kidnap, steal of sabotage. any covert operation short of assassination.
an assassin is activated if the assignment requires the target to be terminated. they aim for the fatal event to be as discreet as possible. If needed, a master may accompany the assassin, along side them or covertly, to ensure the success to the mission.

A contacts life involves monitoring various dead drops for any massage that needs to be delivered. the from and to information is coded, and it is unique for each Contact. they know how to activate the agent. if its not a priority, they can leave the message in their agents dead drop. they may infiltrate their house or business to collect or place messages. if their is a priority, either a master summoned the contact or the master personally approached the contact. in turn the contact will personally deliver the message to the agent. any coded reports from the agent are unencoded by the contact before delivering dropping of to the master's dead drop.

Upon a masters discretion, they may select an agent or contact to ascend to Master. They need to be careful with their selection, as they will need to know all skill sets, more than any zephyr would otherwise need to know. if they fail, they will be terminated. from whatever skill set they have, they will be trained in the other ones. they will build experience in their new skill sets. once the master is satisfied with their experience, they will be inducted as a junior master. under the mentorship of a grand master. A grand master has multiple junior masters at his disposal. they take care of more tedious task, like dealing with contacts, writing massages, parsing information and training recruits. they also advise the grand master and the queen. when a grand master position became vacant. one junior master ascends to grand master. a grand master can overrule any junior master, with only the queen having authority over a grand master. from the info parsed by the junior masters, and their advice as well, they can make decisions based on the queens wishes. both master classes may join any zephyr on their assignment, more likely than not covertly. only with assassin mission will the join alongside, if needed. additional, they themselves may undertake any assignment. by themselves, or with any other zephyr, including other masters. if success is critical. like the life of the queen is in danger.

Males can be recruited as agents. They are mostly monitors, very few are ascended to spies or assassins. There a are very few male contacts. They only deal with low priority messages, like surveillance and standard reports. They never ascended to master. 

provide insights and question for the following
Males can be recruited as agents. They are mostly monitors, very few are ascended to spies or assassins. There a are very few male contacts. They only deal with low priority messages, like surveillance and standard reports. They never ascended to master. there are times that a man's touch is needed for missions, like seduction. which a male agent could be more useful than a female

Thunders are the visible arm of the military, dealing with law and order. There are two main branches, Police and Guards. many of their duties overlap, but guard mainly deal with border and territorial integrity, and the safety of nobles. Police deal with maintaining order among the populace and enforcing laws. depending of which branch, they start as a officer or sentry. a sarge is in charge of four others, either officers or sentries. a captain oversee a few sarges of their branch, and a Chief deals with a few captains, of both branches. chiefs answer directly to the local governor, the noble in charge of the region. Peasants may enlist to became a thunder. the local authorities, or the queen herself may conscript or draft as they see fit. Thunders are only female

Thunders are the visible part of the military. because of the inaccessibility of aria territory, appears to justify the relatively small army compare to other races. and their success in defending aria territory makes thunders appear more impressive than they actually are, since any contribution from the zephyrs is either unknown or attributed to thunders. In one historical encounter, an enemy nation attempted to take control of an Aria shadowland. Thunders ready themselves to clash with a much greater army. the night before, however, Zephyrs infiltrated the enemy base. A large deployment of assassins and masters covertly entered during the night. they successfully sabotaged supply chains and armaments, stole enemy plans and communications, planted erroneous intel and fake orders. they also assassinated key enemy leaders. Thus the next day, the thunders fought against a softened army. A triumphant celebration was held in honor of the Thunders who successfully defended the shadowland. proclaiming heroes and honoring the fallen. the zephyrs honored their victory and their fallen in silence. unknown to everyone else but them and the queen. Thunder Chiefs and any Zephyr that is embedded as a thunder may suspect zephyr involvement in their victory, but at the time they focus their role as Thunders, and not Zephyrs. 

from the enemies perspective, successful zephyr op is perceive that a breeze did it. it was the breeze than blue the intel into the fire, it was the breeze that dumped the rations into the river. it was the breeze that took out the general. they still suspect some covert ops, but carried by the Thunders. they blame some failing of them that allowed thunders, a bunch of guards and police, to carry out the covert ops, not suspecting that Aria have a dedicated covert division. further bolstering the thunders perceived prowess. providing some deterrent effect. 
Thunder Chiefs and embedded Zephyrs are used to coordinate with zephyrs. they however act within their role of Thunders, not Zephyrs. Zephyr masters are the ones that maintain battlefield control, they are the generals. with the help of contacts and thunder chief, they make it look like the chief have control. contacts, because the direness of the situation, they cannot be covert in delivering messages. they pose as draftees used to communicate in between with thunder chiefs, and they inject Master's communication.

Because of the time sensitive nature of communication during the invasion,  the overhead of securing Zephyr communication cannot be achieved. They rely on the Contact's skill alone to maintain operational secrecy. 
Embedded Zephyr are Monitors. They report to the Masters about the status of Thunder Forces and of the Thunder Chiefs. During the invasion, they may receive small Zephyr assignments. It is recognized that in such situation, they maintain their Thunder role, for their forces need as much personnel as possible. So embed Zephyrs may become aware of other Zephyrs present. 
The more formidable a Thunder appears, yhe better for the Aria. There are times in which,  if deemed fisable,  a Thunder may be sent somewhere for a vacation or some other excuse. Meanwhile an Zephyr operation is proceeding nearby. At best,  the enemy will conclude that the vacationing Thunder cause all the damage the Zephyr operation caused, somehow. They will be unable to figure out how the Thunder caused all the damage. A breeze did it. The vacationing Thunder would be un aware of tbe Zephyr op that she is being accused of performing. 

The boomerang blade is the weapon of choice  for the Aria. Their military wields them, as do some nobles. Boomerang blades can be thrown an will return back to the thrower. The most common version is made of sharpened metal, thou blunt wooden ones exist. Boomerang blades tend to be small enough that one can be wielded in each hand, and a few spares can be attached to their belts.  The most common shape have a single bend. Other shapes are ones that include a second set of bends, one shaped like a ring,  disc and cross. Zephyrs wield two primary boomerang blade and up to four secondary attached to their belt. Thunders wield two secondary and one primary. And one primary. A Thunder's primary boomerang blade is unlike any other variant. A thunders primary boomerang blade is large. They are best used as a two handed melee weapon rather than a ranged weapon. They can still be thrown, but because of their size, it loses impact. 

The base boomerang blade has high slash damaged, moderate pierce damage and no blunt damage. It also has high range. different variants modify this stats. double bend increases slash and range to excellent, wooden reduce slash and pierce to none and raise blunt to moderate, ring increases range to excellent and reduces blunt to none, disc increases range slash and to excellent, pierce to none and blunt to moderate. cross increase range, slash and pierce to excellent. The Heavy variant that Thunders use has moderate range, excellent slash, moderate pierce and blunt. 

Military capes have metallic components in addition to cloth in construction, serving as armor and increasing their defense. Zephyr capes have an inner layer of light metal chainmail, thiss provides a low defense increase. they prefer the light armor as it doesn't hinder their mobility. the design of zephyr capes mimic regular capes styles as to maintain their concealment. this also limit the defense their capes provide since normal capes aren't design to provide defense, they can be too short to provide coverage. monitors use the lightest capes, which use a wire mesh as the inner layer to enhance their defense, providing very low defensive capabilities. Thunders use medium and heavy capes. In addition to cloth, their capes are made of metal scales, providing moderate defense. they are long enough to cover most of the body. The heavy variant uses thicker scales. the scales have rough cloth covering to provide some style. heavy capes provide moderate high defense.

Cloudcrete is the material used to build their cloud lands. it is a combination of two minerals, Plumice and Luffstose. Plumice is a very lightweight rock that floats on water. Luffstose can form resilient fibers. the two stones are grounded and mixed with water. the slurry is then super heated in a pressured container. after some time, the pressure is released. the slurry then expands into a fluffy clay, cloudcrete.  this clay is used to form construction material, like bricks mortar, paste and other things. as it cures, the outer surface becomes fluffy like a cloud, the inner core becomes solid. the fluffy patina protect the inner core from unraveling. the thicker the solid core is, the fluffier the patina. Cured Cloudcrete is neutrally buoyant in air. that is to say  that it remains locked in space. it can hold up to ten times it weight before it start to sink. they uncured clay is not buoyant. Cloudcrete exibits properties similar to clouds. it absorbs water around, and can release it as rain or snow, depending of temperature. it can also produce thunder and lightning.

While plumice and luffstose can be found I a variety of places, they are typically minned in their shadowlands. That is how the Aria came to posses those lands. Before there were shadowlands and cloudlands, Aria explores found deposits of plumice and luffstose in the region. They manufactured cloudcrete and started building structures over the region. Over time, the cloud structures grew immense that it cast a shadow over the their mines.  Eventually becoming the cloudlands and shadowlands. 

a couple of consideration with the usage of cloudcrete. The uncured clay is not buoyant. it is prefer for they clay to be used at the construction site as it is cumbersome to change its height once cured. its horizontal placing is much easier to shift. the entire cloudland can shift in fierce winds. as such, the cloundlands are anchored to either shadowland or the toplands they extend.  Cloudcrete is also mined and used in the mountain tops the also inhabit. mainly for asthetics, as traditional materials are readily accessible. it is also used to extend the edge of the mountain top. Traditional materials are also used. 
Cloudcrete does actually sink, but at an imperceptible rate. Unkempt cloudcrete will eventual fall down. The fluffy patina erodes and needs to be maintained. when the the solid core is exposed, it will unravel to new patina, losing part of it buoyancy in the process. eventually, it wont be buoyant enough that is will start falling like a rock. 
properly maintained cloudcrete structure can support ten times its weight before it stats to noticably sink. the wight of the cloudcrete itself is not a factor. the people, furniture, food, apliances and anything not made of cloudcrete are a factor of that weight limit. traditional material are used in cloudlands for aesthetics and versatility, sometimes a wooden or stone structure is better than a cloudcrete one. they are placed on a cloudecret foundation or chained to a cloudcrete anchors, which is like a balloon, to offset the structures weight.

the shadolands show a gimps of the dark aspect of aria society. since the primary value of the shadowlands is the manufactured of cloudcrete, all else is secondary. the vast majority of the population are laborers, miners. Any nobles and clergy are there in support of the mining operation. this is viewed as an undesirable assignment. the land is devastated from the mining. any farmland available is very low yield, since it sits under the cloudlands shadow. most of the food either comes from the cloudlands or toplands, or is imported from neighboring nations. making the population highly dependent to others. the military presence is not only used to defend the shadowlands from invaders, but also to pacify the populaces. it is not uncommon for zephyrs to defect with rebel uprisings, seeing the unfairness others suffer while they have some protection because of their status as zephyrs. all this in the service to the populations on the cloudlands and toplands. there are kingdoms that have fallen because of the failure on the shadowlands, either the mines ran dry, or uprising were successful.  

Topland populations are not dependent on cloudcrete. as such, there mining operations are more sustainable compared to cloudland kingdoms. the stratification is not as harsh. everyone enjoys the natural protection of living on a mountain mesa top, unlike shadowland populations that are vulnerable. 
Cloudland populations live a relatively peaceful life style. both peasant and nobles alike. but at the expense of the populations of the shadowlands below. they are mostly unaware since there isn't much migration between the two populations. 

To be clear, Aria kingdoms come in two types, topland kingdom and cloudlands kingdoms each are ruled by a queen. They both have shadowlands but their nature are different. Shadowlands from toplands are formed by expansion of the mesa's edge by using cloudcrete. The cloudcrete is extracted from the mesa itself. The shadowlands is populated, but not necessarily for mining.
The cloudlands are dependent on cloudcrete, and the shadowlands are used for its ectraction. Because of the dependacy, separation and vulnerability, there is a stark contrast between the lives of those who live in the cloudlands and their shadowlands. The cloudlands are more utopian while their shadowlands are more distopian. 

A key distinction between the two types of kingdoms is their defensibility. Both are hard to reach,  but cloudlands are harder. Waring nation against topland kingdom may reach their population. In contrast, cloudlands population don't really suffer war until it's to late. Since it is the shadowlands that takes the full force of an invading army, spearing the cloudlands population from its devastation.  Unless untill the shadowlands fall, only then do cloudland population star suffering from the war. If the shadowlands successfully repel the invaders, cloudlands population won't even know that they just won a war. 

and interesting characteristic of a fallen cloudland kingdom. One defensive strategy is to induce the cloudlands to generate lightning and thunder. this makes passage thru the shadowlands dangerous. since the kingdom fell, the lightning and thunder generation wasn't turned off. as such the cloudland ruins are constantly generating lightning, battering the shadowlands below. this makes and interesting place for traveler and adventures to pass thru. the constant lightning and thunder generation further degrades the cloudcrete, putting any one below at risk of being struck by falling debris.

the lightning generation of cloudland is also used for other things. first, i can happen naturally. depending of the temperature, water content, and wind strength and  direction, lightning may happend on its own. the cloudland population can also induce lightning on the cloudcrete. mainly for festivities and celebrations. it is used to create beautiful light displays. some hooligans may use it to create graffiti. it can also be used as emergency illumination. there is still some danger of electrocution if not careful. hovering a bit higher, or stepping in insulating material, like wood and stone, help protect from electrocution. while this is happening there are lightning strike in the shadowlads. so festivities on the cloudlands means lightning storm in the shadowlands. another use is to pacify uprising in the shodow lands. but this is used as last resort, as widespred lightning is uncomfortable to the cloundland population, and may damage buildings

The Aria can naturally levitate, it does require effort, but not much different than other comparable action. hovering about their foot's length above the ground is the same just standing. moving about at that height is the same as walking. moving faster is like running. moving up is like walking uphill. as long as they have stamina, they can keep climbing. they can remain at the same height like if they were just standing.  if they tire themselves out, they may fall down to the ground.

Female aria can become part of the Clergy, there is a dedicated sub industry dedicated to prepare an aria to pass the entry exam. unfortunately, some are scams. preparation can be expensive. the test itself also comes with a hefty fee. failure bars the person from retaking it for one year. and the test keep changing. the exam test the persons knowledge in reading, writing, math, history, art and literature. very high marks are required to pass. once passed and admitted, they can request apprenticeship with accountants. once their apprenticeship is over, they can be hired as accountants. They are subject to retesting and audits, at various frequencies, depending on what business they are accounting for, to make sure their skill dont fade, and their work is perfect. failure to pass may incure a gefty fine or barring their profession for a period of time and the take a reentry exam. accountants can persue further specialization. bookiping, recorder, scribe, tax collector, lawyer, judge, librarian and also medical. they will seek either apprenticeship to a professional or admittance to a school, depending on the specialization.  once they have experience, they can seek to become an Auditor. an auditor administer all the test and audits in their respective fields. they may try to specialize in more than one field, but it is challenging. medical is different from the others. they attend both school and apprenticeship. audit or testing failures result in retraining, not a fine or barring. Aria medical are renowned thru out the land. even in foreign lands, Aria led hospitals are established. Aria medical personnel in foreign nation help establish diplomatic relationships. Aria Medical have their own uniform, a capeless salmon colored assemble.

Typical life of a female peasant:
The mother with take raise her child. depending on the financial state of the mother, the child's upbringing may be different. a poor class peasant may raise them fully alone. a low class may afford to maintain a male homemaker. he will tend her home and her child while she is working. a middle class most likely the male homeowner is the child's father, but is is not a garantee, nor a matter of concern. while he may be a parental figure to the child, it is not a father daughter relationship, but a master-servant one. A middle class mother may keep more domestic workors, including poor and low class females. High class mothers may have a larger domestic servitude, which include Major Domos. they help raise the child. if the mother herself is a domestic servant, to a high class clergy, military or nobility, they may raise their own child along side their masters. When the child is older, a poor and low class  child may assist their mother in their job, low to mid class may send the child to a schoolhouse, mid and high class may hire a private tutor. the tutor and and schoolhouse teacher are clergy librarians. If they want to join the clergy, they best start preparing no later than their teens. once they are able bodied, they officially join the labor force. if they want to join thunders, they may enlist at this age. also, Zephyrs may start kidnapping potential recruits at this time, especially if the leave their mothers home to find work. poor and low may still live at their mothers home. low and mid may live near their mothers, mid and high may leave their neighborhood al together. they may have gainful jobs, loose their jobs and move down a class, they may get a better job and move up a class. they may start courting males and start a family. High, clergy and nobles may send their male children to poor, low and mid class females to care for them. poor, low and mid class also take care of their elderly mothers. on day they themselves will be taken care of by their daughters. High class elderly females can retire and don't need their daughter to care for them, when they pass, their daughter, or someone else significant, like the homemaker or major domo oversee the funeral, cremating the body and scattering their ashes into the wind.

Typical life of a male peasant:
When any male child is born, from low class to nobles, the homemaker or Major Domo are given the choice of what to do with them. there is a good chance they are the child's father, but it is not guarantied, nor important. they may chose to keep them in the household or handed to a lower class households. the household servitude, mostly the male servants, with some involvement of female servants. take care of the male child. A high class, clergy or noble Major domo may elect to pass the male child to a family in their servitude, basically they stay in the household, but they are raise by another family. a low class homemaker may elect to keep the child in the household, and since they are the only domestic servant. it is close to a father-son relationship. poor class mother may elect to keep the male child, being the only mothers to raise their sons, or give them up to an orphanage. all families also have the option to give their male child to an orphanage instead. if they are kept in the household, they are effective raised along side their sisters. if they are sent to another household, the female children there became their sisters. the female children, their sisters have priority over any male child in the household. the head of the household, mother of the sisters, she essentially ignore any male children, it is not their concern. the head male domestic worker, homemaker or major domo, are the once that raise the male child, with support of other domestic servants if available. poor and low class females may not have the luxury to neglect the male children in her household, but are involve very rarely. When the child is old enough, they may assist in domestic chores of the household. poor, low and mid class may send the child to a school house, but their education is limited. when they are able bodied, they most likely continue being a domestic servant, either with their family or hired by a female to tend their home. there are limited work opportunities outside domestic work, like cleaning, cooking and farming. they may be courted by females, and became their husbands until the female decided to end the relationship. or a high class, clergy and noble may hire them for their servitude, including Major Domo, having some education makes them more likely to be hired as major domo, or they may just rise to that position from their domestic work. Major domos are in charge of running a High, clergy, and noble household. it may include multiple lower class families in there service and workforce. they may also carry some consideration by the female head of the household . if Zephyrs decide they need a male agent, they may kidnap them at this age. any elderly males are taken care by the servitude. and when they pass, they are the ones how perform their funeral rites. the head of the household may not necessarily be present, but it sometimes happens

Provide a description of the following :
Poor class peasant are those without gainful employment, either constantly moving from job to job, or unemployed. Low class have long-term but low paying job, like mining and farming. Mid class have decent paying jobs, like construction. High class pesant have high paying jobs like merchant and traders. Clergy accountants start similar to mid class, further clergy advancements are equivalent to high class peasants. Auditor are similar to low ranking nobles. Nobles control vast resources and tax the population. They don't suffer any needs. Thunders range between mid and high class, depending of their rank.
