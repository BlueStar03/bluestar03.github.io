## Working Notes

This is a description of a race of people that live in the world of Threa, the Nink.

The Nink are the smallest of all the races. no taller than one foot. They are unable to produce most sounds in speech. The sounds they make are whistles and bells. They levitate and float everywhere.  They don't walk. 

On their appearance. They are small, no taller than a foot in height. Their skin is covered in fur. They have wet noses. they have wide round ears folded behind their heads; female ears are larger. They have prominent upper incisors. for females, the inner pair tend to be prominent. for males it is the outer pair. They have four finger hands and three toed feet. They have long, thin tails. they also have detached non corporal wings.

Ninks have a wide variety of color, browns, reds, yellow, greys, blues, purple, sage, and plenty more. The colors fall on two groups, Warm and Cool colors. Females have cool colored fur, warm colored hair. Males have warm colored fur, and cool colored hair. Their eyes are different in color. Male right and female left eyes are of a warm color, with female right and male left eyes being a cool color. The opposite can happen, a male with cool colored fur and other combinations, but it is not common to happen. 

another aspect is that they have immaterial wings. females tend to have one pair, and males tend to have two. these wings have no physical presence whatsoever. they phase through everything. They don't aid in flight in any manner. The Nink themselves have little control over them. of particular note is that the pattern and colors change depending on the individual's emotional state. one interesting consequence is that they have a hard time lying. The color and pattern of their wings change when they lie. with skill however, they can gain control over their wings

the nink grab items in a particular way. they don't grab with their hands. they can, but most of the time, they grab items without physical connection. the item they grab appears to float as they handle the item. This non physical link has limits. it has a limited reach, beyond that , they item just drops. also, while the Nink is holding the item, if someone else manipulates the item, they can drag the nink along, until the nink lets go of the item. a typical Nink can grab two items at a time with a reach five times their arms can reach. a skilled nink can grab up to seven items, and increase their reach 20 times their arm length.

there are four major population. they are all self sufficient and nearly isolated from each other. they each reside in four distant location. The North Tree, the Western Caves, Southern Falls and the East Cliffs. Every three months they all migrate at the same time to the next location. A consequence of their migration is that each population only ever experiences one season. Each population is referred to by the season they experience. The Summer, Spring, Autumn, and Winter Ninks. A small crew stays behind each residence in order to maintain them while everyone is migrating. This also allows a bit of contact between each population.

at the begin of the year, the Summer ninks reside in the northern tree, autum ninks are at the western caves, winter ninks at the southern falls, and spring ninks at the eastern cliffs. and they migrate in that order.
As an example, the when the summer ninks are at the northern tree. It is summer there. When summer is about to end, they fly for a week to the Western caves, where summer is just beginning. three months later, summer started to end at the western cave. they go and migrate for a week to the southern falls. where spring just ended, and summer is beginning, three months later, when summer end at southern falls and autumn starts to set in, the migrate toward the east cliffs, where summer is starting. Three months later, they migrate back to the north tree, and continue the cycle. They only experience one season. They chase the same season across Threa. The same for the other populations. When the summer ninks leave the northern tree, the autumn ninks will arrive in a week, when it is autum in that region. and when the autum Ninks leave the northern tree, the winter ninks arrive. and three months later, winter ninks leave and the the spring ninks. and lastly, the spring ninks leave the northern tree and the summer nink arrive once again . Because of their migration, many people in Threa believe that it is the Nink that brings the seasons. it is during the Migration week in which the Ninks may experience contact with other races of Threa. Some towns along their migration path may welcome them and offer a place to rest.

each population has their own clothing style, suited for the season they each case. Summer nink wear shorts and tanktops, Autumn ninks wear more sturdy clothing, Winter ninks wear warm coats, and spring Ninks wear breathable clothing. 

during the migration, a Nink may leave the flock. They may fall behind, be left behind or leave on their own. The flock won't wait for anyone. The lost ones may chase the flock and arrive late or go back. either one is dangerous. a lone Nink, being small, are vulnerable on their own. They may choose and wait in place for the next flock to pass in three months, or an entire year for their own flock to pass by again. Either way, they will end up experiencing seasons they have never experienced before. During their wait, they may interact with the rest of threa. like staying in a Lor town, or Murai farm. some may choose to abandon Nink society all together and live among the other societies of Threa. or they may be lost completely. wanting to rejoin but unable to find bearing, unable to navigate back. their lack of voice, being that they only whistle and bell sound, doe make it hard to live outside nink society

The Northern Tree: it is actually a small forest of large, evergreen trees, there is one very large tree in the center of the forest. The Nink live in their branches and inside their trunks and in other nooks and crannies. There is great activity during the summer. The ninks harvest moss and other plants from the ground, they hunt rabbits and herd squirrels. During the autum, they gather insects and herbs from the canopy. they gather fur from their squirls for textile production. during the winter, pinecones and nuts are their main food source. when spring arrives, fruits are bountiful, vines and petals are gathered for textiles

Additions. During the summer, they focus on ground resources, so they have to contend with foxes. during autumn, they spend time in the canopy, and have to fend for crows, ravens, and hawks. During the winter, they defend themselves from weasels that raid their food stores. During spring, snakes are a danger. 

The Nink not only care for their own flock, but also for the next one. for example, the autumn ninks make sure the food stores are full for the winter ninks. and the winter ninks tend the borrows of hibernating creatures, so they are safe to emerge for the spring ninks. They also build nest during the winter in anticipation of birds nesting during the spring. That way, spring ninks can harvest their eggs. they collect a bounty so that the summer ninks can start planting, which the autumn ninks harvest and store for the winter ninks 

The wester Caverns are a series of labyrinthian caves that permeate the rock in the area. organize from a central tunnel in which the wind howls as it passes by.
