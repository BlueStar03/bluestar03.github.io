# The Elements 

The Elements are the Creators of Threa. Their names are Fire, Wind, Earth, Water, Ice, and Lightning. However, these are not their true natures but the closest approximation. Earth is something with shape, with firmness, which can be solid as stone or crumble like dust. He is strong like a mountain but timid like dust. Water is that which moves back and forth, shapeless and fluid. She is aloof, self-centered, and moody, like a calm pond or a raging wave. Their son, Ice, is that which has shape and can be shaped, which can move and stay, like a glacier or snow. Fire is that which radiates in all directions. He is warm, determined, and passionate, like a hearth that fills a room with warmth and light, or a volcano that spews consuming lava. Wind is force, the push and pull at a point in a direction. She is thoughtful and headstrong, like a gentle breeze pushing a boat or a hurricane pulling up trees. Their daughter, Lightning, is that which is energy, action, that which moves everything. She is spontaneous and energetic, like a sudden flash that wakes everyone up, or the crackle that lifts hair to its ends.  

A way to view their characterizations: Earth is "Firmness," Water is "Fluidity," Fire is "Radiance," and Wind is "Force." Ice is "Being," and Lightning is "Action." Fire is emotion, how a smile radiates happiness, and crying fills a room with sadness, like a flame fills a room with light. Wind is thought, for it is thought that directs movement, from here to there. It is breath which drives force. Lightning, the daughter of Fire and Wind, is both. Emotion and thought create action, the spirit. Earth is what has form, like bones and flesh. Water is what flows, like blood. Ice, the son of Earth and Water, is both form and fluid, flesh and blood, being the body. Together, Ice and Lightning make sentient life.  

Their personalities are akin to a nerd, misfit, jock, and cheerleader. Earth is the nerd. He knows how to build but is afraid to change what has worked so far, fearing he has made a mistake. He is infatuated with Water and aspires to be as confident as Fire. Water is a misfit. She is self-centered and just wants to go where she desires, doing what she wants, not caring about anyone else. She changes her mind constantly, doing one thing one day, then doing something else the next. She doesn't stick to one idea. She doesn't notice Earth but looks up to Wind. Fire is a jock, thinking he is the best at everything, even in things he is bad at. He has a rivalry with Wind and thinks of Earth as his little brother. Wind is the cheerleader, full of energy and competitive, but she is indecisive. She doesn't want to be outdone by Fire and thinks of Water as a little sister that can be molded by her. Ice and Lightning are the younger. Ice is an introvert, reserved, and thinks before acting. Lightning is an extrovert, impulsive, and acts before thinking.  

This metaphysical aspect is the true nature of the Elements, but it is unknown even to them. As such, they do not know the true extent of their power and potential.  

Their elemental aspect is simpler to perceive and comprehend. The names Fire, Wind, Earth, Water, Ice, and Lightning are simply the easiest way to understand them. It is not that Fire controls fire, but that which radiates, which fire does. Wind isn't just wind, but that which exerts force, like the wind. Earth is not rocks, but that which is firm, like rocks. Water's dominion isn't water, but that which flows, like water does. Ice isn't ice, but that which can be formed, like ice, which has little to no energy. And Lightning isn't lightning, but that which acts, that moves, like lightning, which has little to no form.  

The metaphysical nature of the elements, their true selves, is unknown to them. Earth represents stability. Water signifies change. Together, they created Ice, which embodies matter. Fire symbolizes emotion. Wind represents thought. Together, they created Lightning, which signifies energy. This explains why Ice and Lightning were able to create the Nawa, the first people of Threa. Matter, being stable yet capable of change, provided the body, including bones and blood. Energy, encompassing emotion and thought, provided the soul, filling the body with warmth and enabling breath. At its core is the heart, which is both firm and constantly changing, influencing the body through thoughts and emotions. When the heart ceases to function, the person can no longer think or feel, and the body can no longer move or change. The essences of the elements separate: warmth ceases, the final breath is taken, blood stops flowing, and the body decays.

# Appearance 

They display an ethereal appearance with a faint, immaterial glow shaping their heads, arms, and bodies, which fades like a cloak. Their eyes are illuminated by white glows. The wisps of their shapes are distinguished by distinct colors: Red for Fire, Magenta for Wind, Green for Earth, Cyan for Water, Blue for Ice, and Yellow for Lightning.  

- Fire's body is that of a lean, tall, and strong man. His red wisps flicker like flames, and his hair rises upward resembling fire.  
- Wind's body resembles a graceful lady, glowing in magenta. Her ethereal wisps swirl around her, and her hair splits into two long, flowing tails that curve downwards and outwards.  
- Earth's body is stout and broad, like a youthful man with long, strong arms. His green ethereal wisps form into hard, solid lines.  
- Water's body is that of a youthful woman, with cyan wisps flowing and splashing across her body, and four tendrils flowing down her hair.
- Ice's body is that of a young, reserved boy. His blue wisps crystallize into snowflakes, and crystals form in his hair.  
- Lightning's body is that of a young, energetic girl. Her yellow wisps crackle across her body, and bolts of lightning shoot down her hair.  

They can exist in Threa as their elemental form. They can travel without restrain. But after the finished Threa, they all assumed mortal forms. They can take any aspect they wish, but prefer the pure races of their creation. Fire takes om the aspect of a Lor, Wind of an Aria. Earth puts on the guise of a Dis Com, and Water of a Ma Hir. Ice looks like a Frill, and Lightning looks like a Duga
